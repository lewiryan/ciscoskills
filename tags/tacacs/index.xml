          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/user.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/user.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;User&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_protocol&#34; title=&#34;AAA protocol&#34;&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; which in the Cisco world means, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication&#34; title=&#34;Authentication&#34;&gt;Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization&#34; title=&#34;Authorization&#34;&gt;Authorization&lt;/a&gt;, and Accounting but what does that really mean? In today&#39;s post that&#39;s what we are going to be talking about. What is AAA and what are the benefits of using it along with what is it? The first &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; of AAA is Authentication which provides the method of identifying users, including login and password dialog, challenge and response, messaging support, and, depending on the security protocol you select, encryption. The second &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; of AAA is Authorization which provides the method for remote &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control&#34; title=&#34;Access control&#34;&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;, including one-time authorization or authorization for each service, per-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_%28computing%29&#34; title=&#34;User (computing)&#34;&gt;user account&lt;/a&gt; list and profile, user group support, and support of IP, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork_Packet_Exchange&#34; title=&#34;Internetwork Packet Exchange&#34;&gt;IPX&lt;/a&gt;, ARA, and Telnet. The third and last &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; of AAA is Accounting which provides the method for collecting and sending security server information used for billing, auditing, and reporting, such as user identities, start and stop times, executed commands (such as PPP), number of packets, and number of bytes. In a real world scenario I like to think of AAA has a police officer or a security guard that is blocking access to a building, they first want to make sure that they know who you are and you give the correct credentials that prove to them you are who you say you are. Once they have verified who you are they will want to check if you are authorized to enter the blocked building once they have approved you to have access they will be able to track or keep a record that you accessed the building. That is the same type of idea that the router or switch will do. Months ago I talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TACACS&#34; title=&#34;TACACS&#34;&gt;TACACS&lt;/a&gt; Plus and RADIUS these are both used to control access to the network. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/10/tacacs-plus-and-radius/&#34; title=&#34;TACACS Plus and RADIUS&#34;&gt;TACACS Plus and RADIUS&lt;/a&gt;) You could say these services are the security guards or police officers. By using AAA it provides the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased flexibility and control of access configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardized authentication methods, such as RADIUS, TACACS+, and Kerberos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple backup systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you apply AAA to a network you now have full control of each network device that supports AAA. The user database is stored on the RADIUS or TACACS+ server, so instead of configuring and putting passwords and usernames for each network device once you configure a username and password on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS&#34; title=&#34;RADIUS&#34;&gt;AAA server&lt;/a&gt; it now can get access to each network resource. You can also give that user certain privileges by specifying if that user can access that device. AAA is like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory&#34; title=&#34;Active Directory&#34;&gt;Active Directory&lt;/a&gt; in the Windows Server environment. You can do a lot of configuration and really lock down your network infrastructure. AAA is not just for routers and switches in IT environments. This type of service can be used VPNs and regular users that use network resources. That&#39;s what I have for AAA if you want to find more information about it go to Cisco.com and like always I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea for any ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know by issuing a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TACACS Plus and RADIUS</title>

          &lt;p&gt;TACACS+ and RADIUS are both used to control access to network resources, but both of these protocols are different in how they operate depending how you want to secure your network. These protocols need to have (AAA) authentication, authorization, and accounting setup on the routers before you can set up these access server protocols.  First let&#39;s get some information on why we would need this type of access server protocol setup. Usually you will find this setup in medium to enterprise environments. What the access server does is provide a central location of all the users and privileges these users can do on network resources. If we did not have a server we would have to put these users manually on the Cisco IOS software and that could be time-consuming depending on how many devices (routers, switches) there are in your network infrastructure. So what can RADIUS and TACACS+ do? Both can provide a central location on who can access the network resources but both are different in how they authorize users. RADIUS is an access sever that uses the AAA and uses the UDP protocol. For Network security the information that is sent between the client and the server is authenticated by a shared password which is never sent over the network. Also any user passwords are encrypted between the client and the server. However one thing that is different between TACACS+ and RADIUS is with TACACS+ the whole packet is encrypted, RADIUS only encrypts the password everything else is in plain text for example the user name. RADIUS is able to support a variety of methods to authenticate a user when a username and password are sent. RADIUS can support PPP, PAP, CHAP, UNIX login and other authentication mechanisms. Over TACACS+ RADIUS is also available for free at various websites. Finally RADIUS combines authentication and authorization meaning once the user has been granted access the RAIDUS server is done and no longer is involved. RADIUS sends the privileges to the network device and it is up to the device to be able to allow or disallow certain commands and functions. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/tacacs-plus-and-radius/raidus/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/raidus.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;RAIDUS Server&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP which offers several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCP usages provide a separate acknowledgment that a request has been received, regardless of how loaded and slow the backend authentication mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCP provides immediate indication of a crashed, or not running, server by a reset (RST). You can determine when a server crashes and returns to service if you use long−lived TCP connections. UDP cannot tell the difference between a server that is down, a slow server, and a non−existent server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using TCP keepalives, server crashes can be detected out−of−band with actual requests. Connections to multiple servers can be maintained simultaneously, and you only need to send messages to the ones that are known to be up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCP is also more scalable and adapts to growing, as well as congested, networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned above TACACS+ encrypts the entire packet, besides the standard header, RADIUS only encrypts the password. TACACS+ uses the AAA protocol like RADIUS but during a session the client checks with TACACS+ server to determine if the user is granted permission to use different commands and or functions. By doing this it provides greater control over commands that can be executed on the network resources. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/tacacs-plus-and-radius/tacacs/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tacacs.png?w=100&#34; alt=&#34;TACACS+ Server&#34; title=&#34;TACACS+&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This may sound like TACACS+ is the preferred protocol but this all depends on your network needs RAIDUS is a great protocol for just usernames and passwords so in the end it all depends but both offer a central environment and that&#39;s my summary of the two protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
