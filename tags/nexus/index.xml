          &lt;p&gt;So what has changed in the past 20 years? Take for example the network equipment that was manufactured in 1997, how did you configure that equipment? I would imagine it involved a serial port, HyperTerminal and trusty command line. Was API even a thing back in 1997, was it common to have an API interface in network equipment like today? Why do we even need an API on the equipment in the first place? What changed?  Well the year isn&#39;t 1997 anymore, that past us 20 years ago and the equipment we work with today looks and operates much differently than it did in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work in a world now that operates with Gbps/Tbps not Kbps/Mbps. With the need for speed CLI isn&#39;t the fastest thing anymore to configure or monitor network devices. This industry is moving into automated ways to configure and monitor network devices. So in this post we&#39;ll look at enabling the NX-API that&#39;s in the Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 family switches, and in foing this we&#39;ll get introduced into the Cisco NX-API sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable this API  jump right into CLI and configure the management interface, we&#39;ll be able to use this API using the management IP address of the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;vrf context management
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;interface mgmt0
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;  description OOB Management
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;  vrf member management
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;  ip address 172.16.1.192/24
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the management interface is configured we now can enable the NX-API by one command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;nx-osv9000-1# config t
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;nx-osv9000-1(config)# feature nxapi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a web browser to the management IP address and login with a username and password.

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to NX-API Sandbox! With this we can play around to get a further understanding of how to use this API. Like being able to configure and or monitor this device with either a custom home-grown system, or the use some network automation software like Puppet or Chef.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-now-what&#34;&gt;So now what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well if you are like me and really don&#39;t have much programming experience or just enough to be dangerous this where you get comfortable and use this sandbox to understand what it can and cannot do. For example on the upper right hand side, if I select &lt;strong&gt;XML&lt;/strong&gt; on the message format, then &lt;strong&gt;cli_show&lt;/strong&gt; on the command type, followed by typing the command &lt;strong&gt;show hostname&lt;/strong&gt; in the CLI command box, and finishing by selecting the post button, I should see an output of an XML request as well as the XML response from the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; encoding=&amp;#34;UTF-8&amp;#34;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;ins_api&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;cli_show&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.0&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;sid&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;eoc&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/sid&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;outputs&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;nx-osv9000-1&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/hostname&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;show hostname&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/input&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;msg&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Success&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/msg&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;200&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/output&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/outputs&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/ins_api&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Sandbox is a loose term here as any configuration viewed or applied is live on the equipment, don&#39;t play in the sandbox on production equipment. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post just scratches the surface of what you could do with this API, being able to either write something yourself or using third-party software to help configure and maintain network equipment makes your job easier. Although we still have equipment and even people today that still like those three letters &amp;quot;CLI&amp;quot;, being able to use an API that can configure and maintain provides options for these devices, and who doesn&#39;t like that?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don&#39;t get stuck with &#34;speed-groups&#34;</title>
      <link>http://archive.ciscoskills.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2016/12/dont-get-stuck-with-speed-groups/</link>

          &lt;p&gt;I was working with a Cisco 9372TX switch, and on it I had two 40Gbps uplinks that we where using out of the available four. Talking with our VAR because we where planning on connecting in additional equipment that only supported SFP+ interfaces. So the solution was to connect to this switch  with QSFP to SFP+ adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking this would be a simple change because we are just plugging in additional adapters on the QSFP ports we planned our maintenance window and rollback plans but I wasn&#39;t expecting a rollback for this one :)   The interfaces were configured in a shutdown status before we plugged in the adapters and cables so didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary, when it was time to do the maintenance let&#39;s bring up the interfaces with the command of no shutdown and we should be up...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well not exactly, I first thought it was the other end so I checked that and its reporting the link is down but it was not in a shutdown status. Looking at the Nexus switch interface I see the words &amp;quot;check speed-group config&amp;quot; under the interface and its in a err-disable status and I&#39;ll be honest I haven&#39;t worked with interfaces that are speed-grouped together so I didn&#39;t know that it was even a thing. A quick search to see if I could &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; the speed-group and configure interfaces individually on their own speed turned up nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up doing a rollback which looked pretty ridiculous because these where just interfaces we couldn&#39;t bring online. It become apparent that I was stuck because with the equipment we had I couldn&#39;t use that 40Gbps uplink, the hardware only supported one speed for all six ports, hence the name &amp;quot;speed-group&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would have to downgrade the link 10Gbps and then we would be able to connect in our additional gear. It&#39;s this kind of stuff where planning out for growth and understanding your hardware limits becomes very important, I didn&#39;t catch it because I have never heard of such thing and our VAR didn&#39;t catch it either. In this case we weren&#39;t maxing out that 40Gbps link and we could afford a downgrade in speed in the meantime. Others may not be so lucky and this could be a problem if you really needed that 40Gbps link or only had 40Gbps on your upstream switches. In the end don&#39;t get stuck with speed-groups! :)&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/dc_640-911.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/dc_640-911.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cisco started this exam back in 2012 and I have thought/semi-studied about this test for about over a year now, just did not feel comfy about it until recently. I took the test last week and passed, however there were some questions on the exam I noticed that weren&#39;t on the exam blueprint so that kind of surprised me. I was happy to still be able to pass the exam but I was caught off guard. So with that I’ll let you know what I used to study and what areas I think might help so you won&#39;t be as &amp;quot;surprised&amp;quot; as I was. Overall the exam did a good job of testing on the NX-OS software and the overall basic networking fundamentals (ICND1 material with touch of Nexus) which is what this test is supposed to be about. However there are questions that surprised me and was not ready because of the lack of information about the test. When I started studying for this exam I read the exam blueprint for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna_data_center/dcicn/exam-topics&#34;&gt;640-911&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea of what to expect but I feel that some things are missing from that blueprint. What also is interesting is of all the material I read and watched there was no mention of it. So here are some areas that I think you should look at before you take the exam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the models of all the Nexus switches like the 2000, 3000, 5000, 6000, 7000, and 9000 portfolios. Know the basics of what each offers and their limitations. It’s also helpful to know what the popular type of connections to use between servers and these switches. (&lt;strong&gt;Read the data sheets&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/data-center-switches/index.html#~products-services&#34;&gt;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/data-center-switches/index.html#~products-services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at buying the CCNA Data Center 640-916 Official Cert Guide, or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Center-Official-Guide-Library-Certification/dp/1587205688/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1431488432&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=ccna+data+center&#34;&gt;Cert Library&lt;/a&gt; which includes the 640-911 and 640-916 books because in chapter two of the 640-916 book it talks about the hardware of Nexus switches which is very valuable considering some this is on the 640-911 exam. I noticed this after the fact!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material I have read/watched: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Center-DCICN-640-911-Official-Guide/dp/1587204541/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1431488432&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=ccna+data+center&#34;&gt;CCNA Data DCICT 640-911 Offical Cert Guide&lt;/a&gt; - Odom &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cbtnuggets.com&#34;&gt;CBT Nuggets&lt;/a&gt; - Anthony Sequeira &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1431487215&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=ccna+data+center&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center - Introducing Cisco Data Center Networking Study Guide&lt;/a&gt; - Todd Lammle &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/groups/ccna-data-center-study-group&#34;&gt;Cisco Learning Network&lt;/a&gt; (CCNA Data Center) I hope this information is helpful and good luck on this exam you’ve been warned :)&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;ve played around with two Cisco Nexus 5672UP switches which will be in production soon but before that I wanted to see what it took to get enhanced vPC online. Along the way I was into some new territory as I never stood up vPC before, so in this post I have posted some things to keep in mind and running-config examples, all of which I hope is helpful for a reference. Before we go into the configuration of vPC I wanted to mentioned that the Nexus 5600 series switch is a newer product in the Cisco Data Center portfolio. I would guess that it would eventually replace the 5500 Nexus switch series but as of this writing Cisco has not put any end of life notice on the 5500 hardware. One of the main differences on the 5600 is the built-in layer 3 capabilities. The 5500 required a layer 3 card that used an expansion slot and only the higher-end Nexus products offered layer 3. To find out more information about the 5600 on Cisco&#39;s website: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/datasheet-c78-730760.html&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches Data Sheet&#34;&gt;Cisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches Data Sheet&lt;/a&gt; So when I was looking at configuration examples I noticed some confusion between a dual-homed FEX setup and an enhanced vPC setup, so I&#39;ll try to clear the air. The &amp;quot;Enhanced&amp;quot; vPC is able to set up an etherchannel link from two different Nexus switches. The host/server that connects to these two different Nexus switches must support Active/Active NICs. This configuration is almost the same if you were setting up a dual-homed FEX but with just Active/Passive NICs setup on the host/server. So here is a question if the configuration is almost the same what needs to be added to support enhanced vPC? The software I am working with is version 7.0(1)N1(1) and we need to enable the features of vpc, fex and lacp. [code]feature vpc feature fex feature lacp [/code] We also need to have some VLANs created on both 5ks. In this example I created 25-35 [code]vlan 25-35[/code] We need to start a VPC domain, this must be the same on both switches. SWITCH 1: [code] vpc domain 1 peer-keepalive destination 169.254.1.2 source 169.254.1.1 [/code] SWITCH 2: [code] vpc domain 1 peer-keepalive destination 169.254.1.1 source 169.254.1.2 [/code] A note about the peer-keepalive, the 5500/5600 Nexus has a dedicated management NIC card on the front of the unit. (Where the power is) The reason I did this was I did not want to waste a 10Gb connection for just a keep-alive link. (Although it can be done :/ )  In this example I don&#39;t have a &amp;quot;dedicated&amp;quot; management network so I decided to use the management NIC of both 5ks. By default you have a another vrf context called management on the 5ks running-config. So on both 5ks I give that vrf context an IP address and directly connected both 5ks together. SWITCH 1: [code] interface mgmt0 vrf member management ip address 169.254.1.1/24 [/code] SWITCH 2: [code] interface mgmt0 vrf member management ip address 169.254.1.2/24 [/code] Another helpful tip that I could not find out was if the management NICs would auto MDI/MDIX. So I just plugged in a straight-though and it works, so you don&#39;t need a crossover cable if you don&#39;t have one nearby. :) We now need to create a vPC peer-link between the two Nexus switches. In this example I am using two 10Gb links, which are the same interfaces on both Nexus switches. (Consistency is your friend) [code] interface Ethernet1/31 channel-group 1 mode active interface Ethernet1/32 channel-group 1 mode active [/code] Both switches are referring to port-channel one for interfaces 31 and 32. In the port-channel we will trunk the vlans we have created earlier along with setting this port-channel into a vpc peer-link. [code] interface port-channel1   switchport mode trunk   switchport trunk allowed vlan 25-35   vpc peer-link [/code] To keep the config short I am only referring to two FEXes in this example. (Remember so far in this post you would do exactly the same configuration if you just wanted to set up dual-homed FEXes) Starting with FEX 101 on SWITCH 1: [code] interface Ethernet1/1   description FEX-101-PORT-1   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface Ethernet1/2   description FEX-101-PORT-3   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface port-channel101   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101   vpc 101 [/code] Continue with FEX 101 on SWITCH 2: [code] interface Ethernet1/1   description FEX-101-PORT-2   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface Ethernet1/2   description FEX-101-PORT-4   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface port-channel101   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101   vpc 101 [/code] Start with FEX 102 on SWITCH 1: [code] interface Ethernet1/3   description FEX-102-PORT-1   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface Ethernet1/4   description FEX-102-PORT-3   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface port-channel102   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102   vpc 102 [/code] Continue with FEX 102 on SWITCH 2: [code] interface Ethernet1/3   description FEX-102-PORT-2   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface Ethernet1/4   description FEX-102-PORT-4   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface port-channel102   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102   vpc 102 [/code] So we have just setup two dual-homed FEXes on the 5672UP switches, here is where we can kick it up a notch to set up enhanced vPC. If I had a host that plugged into FEX 101 and FEX 102 and I wanted to set up etherchannel so that host could send traffic on out both links I would put the following configuration on &lt;strong&gt;BOTH&lt;/strong&gt; switches: [code] interface eth101/1/1, eth101/1/2 channel-group 2 mode active interface eth102/1/1, eth102/1/2 channel-group 2 mode active interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 [/code] Here is the result, this is now an enhanced vPC. Some key points of this setup is be consistent with your configuration, it all has to match on both switches otherwise expect problems to arise. Enhanced vPC offers some high level redundancy, by just looking at the picture below you could have multiple failures and servers and applications would still be accessible. This makes this type of setup a common practice if business needs demand it. So I&#39;ll stop it there like before I hope this information is helpful as a reference.

&lt;p&gt;What about using the QSFP ports instead of the Ethernet1/31 and Ethernet1/32 to connect both switches together using vPC, would that also work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey John, Yes I would think that would work. However I don&#39;t know if I would use the QSFP ports for a vPC link. Those type of ports would be better for uplinks. I don&#39;t think you would be running that much traffic thorough a vPC link unless something is wrong. From what I looked at it seemed like you would want to balance it out. So for example if I had an uplink on 5k-1 to Core-1, I would also want an uplink on 5k-2 going to Core-1. That way the traffic does not need to go through the vPC unless there is a problem. Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, I found your post really helpful. I am in the process of implementing eVPC on 5672 UP. I have few questions with respect to the same, 1.You had mentioned that the host/server that connects to these different Fexes must support Active/Active NICs, does it mean that the host or server should support LACP? What if my host doesn&#39;t support LACP? 2.Can I dual home a VMware ESXi (active-active NICs on route based originating virtual port ID load balancing policy) to the fexes? … 3.Can I configure the fex port channel to static ( mode on) instead of active or lacp ? interface eth101/1/1, eth101/1/2 channel-group 2 mode on interface eth102/1/1, eth102/1/2 channel-group 2 mode on interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 Thanks in advance, Nishant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Kerry, Yes you would be able to add 4 ports in a port-channel to the FEXes. You could almost do the same thing with two 5600s without the FEXes if you wanted. Just setup a VPC and port-channel on both 5600s instead of using the FEXes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for this write up, great information. In my setup the host has 2 10g NICS for a total of 4 uplinks. Would I be able to follow your example here for PO2 but add in all 4 ports? (Ex 101/1/1-4 and 102/1/1-4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Nishant, You don&#39;t have to have Active/Active on the FEXs, you can have a single uplink from a host to a FEX and treat it like a standard port. The example that I showed is something you could do if you had a host that supported LACP. I also believe you can turn off LACP if you needed to and manually put up a port-channel on the FEX. Here is some more info: (Figure 6-5) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/mkt&#34;&gt;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/mkt&lt;/a&gt;_ops_guides/513_n1_1/n5k_enhanced_vpc.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this setup really need 8 network connections between the two nexus 5k and the two nexus 2k? Would it also work with only 4 network connections instead? and in that case would it still be called &amp;quot;dual homed&amp;quot;? I am not sure to understand the advantage of 8 network connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey John, You could use 4 connections instead of 8 you just loose the amount of bandwidth available instead of 40Gbps you would have 20Gbps that is available to the 2ks. It would also still be called a dual homed setup because that 2k switch is connected two different 5k switches. Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan, I was wondering when connecting your server redundatly on Po2 shouldn&#39;t you specify a VPC? For instance you have: interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 but as far as I understand shouldn&#39;t it be assigned a VPC, for example: interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 vpc 2 ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are correct if you would have connected the server directly to the 5ks you have to specify a VPC or if you had a single FEX connected to the 5k. In this example however I&#39;m using FEXes which already have a VPC configured from both 5ks and I&#39;m using port-channels off of those FEXes this is called &amp;quot;Enhanced vPC&amp;quot;. There is a difference between them, when you create an Enhanced vPC you don&#39;t specify a VPC on the FEXes because there is already a vPC created upstream. Regular vPC with FEXes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/configuration_guide_c07-543563.html&#34;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt; Enhanced vPC with FEXes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/layer2/513_n1_1/b_Cisco_n5k_layer2_config_gd_rel_513_N1_1/b_Cisco_n5k_layer2_config_gd_rel_513_N1_1_chapter_01010.html&#34;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt; Hope that Helps, Ryan&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg?w=118&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We are at the last chapters of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265/&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center 640-911 by Todd Lammle&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 12 talks about redundant switched technologies and chapter 13 talks about security. Just like before I will go over the high-points, so let’s get started! &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 12 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: In this chapter we get to learn about Spanning Tree Protocol and some history with it. With networks we like multiple ways to a destination however in the layer two area redundancy does not play well and that’s where spanning tree can help us. So know what spanning tree and its purpose. Spanning tree has several terms that are important to remember for the exam, I would look over page 387. For the exam know some show commands for spanning tree, like &lt;strong&gt;show spanning-tree&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;show spanning-tree summary&lt;/strong&gt;. This chapter also talked about the different types of spanning-tree but could not tell if this would be on 640-911 exam as well as port-channels which helps eliminate blocked STP ports. :) &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 13 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: In the last chapter of 640-911 book we get introduced to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/07/access-control-lists/&#34; title=&#34;Access Control Lists&#34;&gt;access-control-lists&lt;/a&gt; and the types of access-lists that the NX-OS supports, know the difference as well as configuring a standard access list and extended access list also be sure to understand the implicit deny statement at end of every access-list. I would also know how wildcard masking works, (flip the subnet mask). A couple more things I thought would be important to keep an eye out is understand that once an access-list is created that does not mean its active, make you sure to understand how to apply the ACL on an interface. Finally know your show commands for access-lists, like &lt;strong&gt;show access-list&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;show access-list summary&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Overall thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: So thanks for checking out these posts about the 640-911 exam, I hope this give you an idea of what to expect on the exam and good luck, if you decide to take it. Personally I am shooting for May/June timeframe to pass at least the 640-911. I thought this book was helpful but if you went and passed the CCNA or even CCNP it does get a little dry in areas. This exam is introductory but required if you wanted to achieve the CCNA Data Center certification. Remember you need to pass two exams 640-911 and the 640-916 to become CCNA Data Center certified. Check out all the 640-911 exam topics: &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911_dcicn.pdf&#34;&gt;640-911 Exam Topics&lt;/a&gt; A little off topic but interesting to note is as of this writing Todd Lammle is the only author that has published a study guide for the CCNA Data Center, a quick check on Amazon shows that Cisco Press is ready to roll out an official certification guide for the 640-911 in the end of August authored by a Wendell Odom, followed by the 640-916 in January of 2015. I’ll end it here, I hope this information is helpful and comment below if you have any questions on these chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

Feel free to comment below if you have any questions on either of these two chapters. &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 10 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Chapter 10 starts us back in the book, before we do any configuring and we learn about routing protocols, and remember the difference between static and dynamic routing (name implies it) Also know the default administrate distances of the different routing protocols (starts on page 297). We also got a crash course in distance vector, link-state and hybrid routing protocols. Out of RIP, RIPv2, EIGRP and OSPF where does each protocol belong? Know the differences between RIP and RIPv2 (there is a couple of them) Know what EIGRP does and it available features it offers as well as OSPF. &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: This chapter went over the dynamic routing protocols and at a fundamental level but in important one to remember not to just pass the exam but to also go further. There was a lot of good information in Chapter 10 about dynamic protocols. If you have never used/learned about dynamic routing protocols make sure you understand the chapter and go over the review questions. &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 11 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Chapter 11 looks at layer two switching technologies, we get to learn about frame tagging or also called VLANs, make sure you understand how 802.1Q works. We also looked into some configuration options like learning how to set up a trunk link, VTP options and SVIs. Know what the type of modes VTP offers, and what is required when setting up VTP what needs to match? With SVIs know how to enable them and what they are used for because it’s not just a management port. (Hint: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/01/31/configure-router-on-a-stick/&#34; title=&#34;Configure Router on a Stick&#34;&gt;Router on a Stick&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: We went from Layer 3 in the OSI back to Layer 2, we need to know the difference between VLANs as we start to blur the lines when using Router on a Stick configurations. This chapter covered the basics of VLANs an important step to make sure you understand the fundamentals. Same things goes with this chapter, if you have never used/learned about VLANs, VTP, SVIs make sure to go over the chapter and review questions. Short and sweet, please post any questions if you have any about this chapter, I hope this information is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;I previously had the chance to play around with the 5596UP switch, and made some notes on how to configure inter-vlan routing. Since this was a 5596UP switch I needed a layer 3 card to take advantage of it. The next-generation units the 5600 include layer 3 without a card required along with introducing 40GB uplinks! However in this post let&#39;s go back to the basics and configure inter-vlan routing on a nexus switch and in this case I am using a 5596UP.  In this example I have already configured a FEX port with a 2k check out the my earlier post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2013/12/01/connecting-fex-5k-to-2k/&#34; title=&#34;Connecting FEX (5k to 2k)&#34;&gt;Connecting FEX (5k to 2k)&lt;/a&gt; so let&#39;s start right after that and login into the 5k.&lt;code&gt;\[code\]User Access Verification demo5k login: admin Password: Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac Copyright (c) 2002-2013, Cisco Systems, Inc.

The Nexus runs on efficiency and only loads what it needs or configured. This is familiar approach that Linux uses which loads what is installed and nothing else. In the output below we can see all the features that the NX-OS supports followed by the command to turn on Inter-VLAN Routing.```

&lt;p&gt;demo5k(config)# feature interface-vlan
demo5k(config)#[/code]
&lt;code&gt;Just like the Catalyst line we are in configuration mode and let&#39;s create two vlans 50 and 60 with IP addresses.&lt;/code&gt;
[code highlight=&amp;quot;9&amp;quot;]demo5k(config)# vlan 50
demo5k(config-vlan)# name SERVER-A-VLAN
demo5k(config-vlan)# exit
demo5k(config)# interface vlan 50
demo5k(config-if)# description SERVER-A-NETWORK
demo5k(config-if)# ip address 192.168.50.1 255.255.255.0
demo5k(config-if)# no shutdown
demo5k(config-if)# exit
! Create another Interface VLAN!
demo5k(config)# interface vlan 60
demo5k(config-if)# description SERVER-B-NETWORK
demo5k(config-if)# ip address 192.168.60.1 255.255.255.0
demo5k(config-if)# no shutdown
demo5k(config-if)# exit
demo5k(config)#exit[/code]
&lt;code&gt;Let&#39;s verify our creation by doing a **show interface vlan** 60&lt;/code&gt;
[code]demo5k# show interface vlan 60
Vlan60 is down (VLAN does not exist), line protocol is down
Hardware is EtherSVI, address is  547f.ee59.a2c1
Description: SERVER-B-NETWORK
Internet Address is 192.168.60.1/24
MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000000 Kbit, DLY 10 usec[/code]
&lt;code&gt;Let&#39;s look at VLAN 50:&lt;/code&gt;
[code]demo5k# show interface vlan 50
Vlan60 is down (VLAN is down), line protocol is down
Hardware is EtherSVI, address is  547f.ee59.a2c1
Description: SERVER-A-NETWORK
Internet Address is 192.168.50.1/24
MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000000 Kbit, DLY 10 usec[/code]
&lt;code&gt;We can also look at the interface brief:&lt;/code&gt;
[code]demo5k# show ip interface brief
IP Interface Status for VRF &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;(1)
Interface            IP Address      Interface Status
Vlan50               192.168.50.1    protocol-down/link-down/admin-up
Vlan60               192.168.60.1    protocol-down/link-down/admin-up[/code]
&lt;code&gt;VLANs have been created and IP addresses assigned to the interfaces, now let&#39;s configure the 2k. In this example I&#39;ve configured two access ports on the 2k one is in VLAN 50 and another is in VLAN 60. Starting with VLAN 50 on port 1 on the 2k.&lt;/code&gt;
[code]demo5k(config)# interface ethernet 100/1/1
demo5k(config-if)# switchport access vlan 50
demo5k(config-if)# spanning-tree port type edge
Warning: Edge port type (portfast) should only be enabled on ports connected to a single
host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, etc... to this
interface  when edge port type (portfast) is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops.
Use with CAUTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge Port Type (Portfast) has been configured on Ethernet100/1/1 but will only
have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.
demo5k(config-if)# no shutdown
demo5k(config-if)# exit[/code]
&lt;code&gt;You&#39;ll notice the warning when we configure the port as an edge port, in the Catalyst world this is the same as spanning-tree portfast. Let&#39;s next configure port 25 on the same 2k into VLAN 60.&lt;/code&gt;
[code]demo5k(config)# interface ethernet 100/1/25
demo5k(config-if)# switchport access vlan 60
demo5k(config-if)# spanning-tree port type edge
Warning: Edge port type (portfast) should only be enabled on ports connected to a single
host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, etc... to this
interface  when edge port type (portfast) is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops.
Use with CAUTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge Port Type (Portfast) has been configured on Ethernet100/1/25 but will only
have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.
demo5k(config-if)# no shutdown
demo5k(config-if)# exit[/code]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Like before I have covered the topics of the each chapter. Last week we learned about the different IP classes and today we get a course in subnetting. Let&#39;s go over what you should know if you want to pass the exam. **Overview: **It seems I have talked subnetting to death on this blog, repetition, repetition, repetition. So known the advantages of subnetting why would you use it along with knowing what IP subnet zero is. You also should be able to take a classful network and break it into smaller networks some math is involved but it&#39;s not rocket science, if you get lost go over it again you&#39;ll start seeing pattern when subnetting. Since we are subnetting, know the purpose of the subnet mask that&#39;s associated with the IP address. Also be sure you can explain what CIDR is and the difference between a classful network. &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have been around with subnetting you can probably glance over this chapter but I would go over the labs that start on page 190. There is also some more information about subnetting on this blog you can find &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/04/01/part-1-the-joys-of-subnetting/&#34; title=&#34;Part 1 – The Joys of Subnetting!&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/04/23/part-2-the-joys-of-subnetttting-vlsm/&#34; title=&#34;Part 2 – The Joys of Subnetttting – VLSM!&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;. Also another good site for sharping subneting skills is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.subnettingquestions.com/&#34;&gt;subnettingquestions.com &lt;/a&gt;. Believe it or not we have finished the back story to finally get to what we want to know which is Cisco&#39;s data center switches the NX-OS product line. I have mention this before at the start of the series, if you know the material have a CCNA or just been around routing and switching you could have glanced over these earlier chapters. This exam starts at the beginning and if you want to move into CCNP you must have passed the 640-911 and the 940-916. Let&#39;s continue to see what the 640-911 exam topics have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/nexus-pline.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/nexus-pline.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nexus-PLine&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was pretty excited to get my hands on some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Nexus_switches&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Nexus switches&#34;&gt;Cisco Nexus&lt;/a&gt; product line which focuses on switching in the data center. The gear I have is an evaluation unit so I made some notes and one thing I was impressed is how easy it is to connect a Nexus 5K to a Nexus 2k also known as a fabric extender. I have kept it simple as the gear I have is a single Nexus 5596 along with a single Nexus 224TP-E who needs redundancy right? So in this post I&#39;ll explain how to connect a 5k Nexus to a 2k extender. Let’s get started! So I needed a couple of SFPs as the only way to connect the 5k to the 2k is a FET-10G SFP along with that was some multimode fiber (OM3) with LC connectors. Looking at the simple diagram below our end goal is to be able to configure the 2k from the 5k. That is the point of the 2k extenders less switches to manage in the data center.&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/5k-to-2k.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/5k-to-2k.png&#34; alt=&#34;5k to 2k&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once we have made the physical connections lets power both switches on, we won&#39;t need to worry about the 2k switch at all as along we have a physical connection to a parent switch the 5k in our case, but that also could be 7k switch. Just an FYI, I&#39;ve already ran through the simple CLI wizard to setup a username and password but other than that let&#39;s get configuring by entering the familiar command &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;config t&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; [code]User Access Verification demo5k login: admin Password: Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software TAC support: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/tac&#34;&gt;http://www.cisco.com/tac&lt;/a&gt; Copyright (c) 2002-2013, Cisco Systems, Inc.

The commands are petty simple, I first want to go into interface followed by changing the mode of interface and finally giving the interface a FEX associate ID. :!:&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: Since this design is a single stack we need to issue the FEX associate command on the physical interface. If you want redundancy you would usually put the FEX associate command with &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2014/09/10/setting-up-enhanced-vpc-on-nexus-5600/&#34; title=&#34;Setting up Enhanced vPC on Nexus 5600&#34;&gt;channel-groups and vPCs&lt;/a&gt;. Another helpful FYI is if you have channel-groups you don&#39;t need to put the FEX associate command on the physical interface.

One thing I&#39;ve been impressed with the NX-OS it&#39;s that familiar feeling of IOS with some improved differences, Cisco has good documentation on the common and different features when comparing NX-OS and IOS which is below. Like always I hope this post is helpful and I have a couple more Nexus posts in the works but other than that enjoy the remaining of 2013! &lt;a href=&#34;http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Cisco_Nexus_7000_NX-OS/IOS_Comparison_Tech_Notes&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Nexus 7000 NX-OS/IOS Comparison Tech Notes&#34;&gt;Cisco Nexus 7000 NX-OS/IOS Comparison Tech Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick question: why port 1/48 down? I thought you configured that interface/port?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Farhan, Port 1/48 is not down on the 5k but on the 2k port 100/1/48 is down, this is a 1GB copper port and in the example I had nothing connected to the 2k. The 2k has four FEX ports that can be connected to a 5k or a 7k, however in this example I did not issue a command that shows the FEX port status, I&#39;ll do some digging in finding an example but from what I can tell I think the &amp;quot;show interface fex-fabric&amp;quot; would show what uplink it is connected to and the status of the FEX link. Hope that Helps.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/network_cloud_david_klan_01_svg_med.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/network_cloud_david_klan_01_svg_med.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;network_cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have worked with the Nexus 1000v product and wanted to share my thoughts on it. I want to explain in this blog what this product is and what it does.  The Nexus 1000v can be virtual or a hardware appliance and is considered to be a virtual switch that runs in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware&#34; title=&#34;VMware&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;. The major benefit to this product is the visibly you get when running in a virtual environment. Remember in the virtual environment the network engineer has a cloudy vision of what&#39;s going, because the built-in switch within VMware does not get that technical it just works. This is fine for most people but not all, especially the network technicians we want that visibly and the Nexus 1000v does that and more! The Nexus replaces the built-in switch in VMware and installs a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine&#34; title=&#34;Virtual machine&#34;&gt;virtual machine&lt;/a&gt; called the VSM (Virtual Supervisor Module) and depending on the configuration you can have two VSMs for redundancy. These VSMs can be either virtual or a hardware appliance (Nexus 1010) Depending on how many &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESX&#34; title=&#34;VMware ESX&#34;&gt;ESX&lt;/a&gt; hosts you have in your environment each of them will have VEM (Virtual Ethernet Module) which are the work horses and provide packet forwarding. The VSMs and VEMs make up a single Nexus 1000v switch, which appears to be a single modular switch to the network technician. Each VSM can have a maximum of 64 VEMs (or 64 physical ESX hosts) It has always been that server administrators deal with the operating system and the applications running on that server. While the network administrators manage the switches and related policies. The link between the server and switch usually a cable separates these roles, until virtual came along and smashed these roles together usually the server administrator has to deal with it. With the Nexus 1000v these roles are now separate in the virtual environment with added functionality like PVLANs, receive rate limiting, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service&#34; title=&#34;Quality of service&#34;&gt;QoS&lt;/a&gt;, Access Control Lists (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list&#34; title=&#34;Access control list&#34;&gt;ACLs&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP_snooping&#34; title=&#34;DHCP snooping&#34;&gt;DHCP snooping&lt;/a&gt;, SPAN, ERSPAN, AAA, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflow&#34; title=&#34;Netflow&#34;&gt;NetFlow&lt;/a&gt;, SNMP and many other features that are not available with the VMware vSwitch. Check out this marketing video that summarizes the Nexus 1000v. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgksWMUBmcI] I hope this information is helpful, check back in a couple of weeks or so because I want to go through the process of setting up the Nexus 1000v, understanding some basic terminology of the Nexus 1000v and go over the CLI. Anybody that is familiar with Cisco IOS CLI will find that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX-OS&#34; title=&#34;NX-OS&#34;&gt;NX-OS&lt;/a&gt; is almost the same. :)&lt;/p&gt;
