            Short story, I am proud to say that I passed! I have studied off and on in the beginning of the year but I did set a date to take the exam which was June 28th .As that date was getting closer I buckled down and reviewed the materials again and focused in on some areas that IÂ knew I was weak in.
So how was the 640-554 exam, what did I use to pass the exam and what exam am I focusing on next?
