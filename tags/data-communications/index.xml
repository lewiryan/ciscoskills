          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/communication.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/communication.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;communication&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have started looking &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;CCDA&lt;/a&gt; information and some of it is interesting, towards the beginning the material started out at design methodologies. It talked about the &amp;quot;forces&amp;quot; of a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network&#34; title=&#34;Computer network&#34;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; framework and in this post I&#39;ll focus on the business forces that make a new framework necessary. I find it interesting when looking at companies because although &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service&#34; title=&#34;Customer service&#34;&gt;customer service&lt;/a&gt; is important to sustain a company, I also think it will and may already have depend on who embraces the technology wheel, those that do will ultimately win. There&#39;s a catch, just because you have a nice low-riding sports car you wouldn&#39;t want to drive it on a rocky dirt road would you? That&#39;s same thing with some big &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software&#34; title=&#34;Application software&#34;&gt;applications&lt;/a&gt; and services running on a network. You don&#39;t want the network to be your own enemy and unfortunately that usually is the last thing people look at. If a company is serious about their goals there are several things a company will look at to improve their business. Having a strong infrastructure to be able to handle the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer&#34; title=&#34;Chief executive officer&#34;&gt;CEO&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; wrath is good, but this infrastructure has to handle the competition and any new services and applications the organization decides to throw at it. You are only as strong as your weakness link, so the network is especially important because it&#39;s the means of communication with application data, voice, and video. If the network is unavailable so is your applications and services and ultimately &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company&#34; title=&#34;Company&#34;&gt;your company&lt;/a&gt;. There are usually three key areas an organization will look at before moving forward on purchasing an upgraded/new network infrastructure, and usually any other services and products as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return&#34; title=&#34;Rate of return&#34;&gt;Return on Investment&lt;/a&gt; is a big one and most companies and most won&#39;t go ahead until they can see &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money&#34; title=&#34;Money&#34;&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; down this path instead of nothing. What&#39;s in it for me? How will this improve our business? How will this make money instead of draining it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_%28European_Union%29&#34; title=&#34;Regulation (European Union)&#34;&gt;Regulation&lt;/a&gt; is another big one, Why would a company change anything if there already on the top? Sometimes &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam&#34; title=&#34;Uncle Sam&#34;&gt;Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt; has to come along and must companies to be compliant, or they are fined and may even be shutdown. (This adds the twist in the game but this usually helps out the common folk like you and me in the end :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being competitive; You can&#39;t beat a company if you are doing the exact some thing as your &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition&#34; title=&#34;Competition&#34;&gt;competitor&lt;/a&gt;. Being faster, smarter, and changing your techniques often with the competition will make you different from the rest and may even give you some extra steps forward from everybody else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it all comes down the cost and this cost is investment it&#39;s not something lost forever, if done correctly this investment would pay off. Although we may not see it physically you will see an increase in how much scalability the company can handle, the availability of products and services, the performance of application and services and the overall efficiency of whole network infrastructure. It&#39;s simple fact, less downtime equals more productivity and in the end equals money for the company. There is always a balance however, you could argue less downtime equals the more money you have to spend to keep it up and running.  That&#39;s where the balance begins, does it take more money then what the company can produce to keep the systems up 99.99 percent of the time?  Is it worth to drop it to 95 percent up-time to save a couple of thousands or are you now loosing more money than you are saving? These are all questions where everyone has to come to the table and discuss, because it is no longer just an IT problem its an organization problem. The business force for the network is important but there are others, check back to see what technology-related forces exist with the network framework.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Three Tiers</title>

Access Layer, distribution layer and the core layer. Each of them have their own set of functions and is also considered to be a best practice when the network continues to grow and for redundancy along with just a better way to manage it. &lt;strong&gt;The Access layer&lt;/strong&gt; is the layer that devices connect to, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt;, printers, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP_phone&#34; title=&#34;VoIP phone&#34;&gt;IP Phones&lt;/a&gt;. The access layer can include routers, switches, bridges, hubs, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point&#34; title=&#34;Wireless access point&#34;&gt;wireless access points&lt;/a&gt;, etc. The main purpose is providing a means of connecting devices to the network, this is also your first line of defense of controlling who is on your network. &lt;strong&gt;The Distribution Layer&lt;/strong&gt; aggregates the data received from the access layer before it is transmitted to the core for routing to its destination. The distribution layer is like a traffic cop to which it controls the flow of network traffic using policies like routing between broadcast domains by having &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Virtual LAN&#34;&gt;VLANs&lt;/a&gt; which are setup on the access layer. VLANs let you segment traffic on a switch into separate subnetworks. Why would you segment traffic? The main reason is for security you should not have sensitive data on a public network because anybody can reach it, by separating it you also have more control over it on who can get access to it. &lt;strong&gt;The Core Layer&lt;/strong&gt; of the hierarchical design is the high-speed backbone of the network. The core layer is critical for interconnectivity between the distribution layer devices. The core must be highly available and should be redundant. The core can also connect to internet resources, because the core aggregates the traffic from the entire distribution layer it must be able to handle high data traffic. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/01/21/the-three-tiers/hierarchical-layerse/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/hierarchical-layerse.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Hierarchical Layer&#34; title=&#34;Hierarchical Layers&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In small networks it is a common practice to use a collapsed core model to where the distribution layer and core are merged into one layer. If the network grows it is fairly easy to add the core layer. Because you are in hierarchical network you have many benefits which I&#39;ll hold off for another day but in summary they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_%28engineering%29&#34; title=&#34;Redundancy (engineering)&#34;&gt;Redundancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manageability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like always I hope this information is helpful in at least having a better idea of Cisco&#39;s hierarchical network design. One of the hardest things when designing this type of network is if you are trying to change the original one because of poor performance and degradation. Like always if you have an idea of the next topic that looks at ICND1 or ICND2 let me hear it by posting below, or if you have questions feel free to post them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Beginnings of Layer Two Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/08/the-beginnings-of-layer-two-redundancy/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/network-diagram.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/network-diagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;network-diagram&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In a perfect world we would never need redundancy on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Network Layer&#34;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure, but as you know as well as I know we don&#39;t live in a perfect world. Hardware will eventually fail, bottlenecks will appear, and the speed of our network will become slower when we max the bandwidth on links. So having redundancy in routers, connections, and having a hierarchy network is one of best choices to make when improving the efficiently of the network. But in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt; there is one layer that can&#39;t have redundancy at least logically and that is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer&#34; title=&#34;Abstraction layer&#34;&gt;Layer&lt;/a&gt; two of the OSI model. If you follow this blog way back when I talked about the OSI model, layer two belongs to the switches and by design the ethernet frame does not support a TTL (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live&#34; title=&#34;Time to live&#34;&gt;Time-To-Live&lt;/a&gt;) like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol&#34;&gt;IP packet&lt;/a&gt;. So bring forth STP, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Spanning Tree Protocol&#34;&gt;Spanning Tree Protocol&lt;/a&gt; which works at layer two of the OSI model. If more than one path is available in the network the STP algorithm basically shutdowns the redundant links until active link is unavailable (shutdown, disabled, etc.) So although there are multiple links connected physically to offer redundancy, logically the switches in the network only see one path that ethernet frame can travel. &lt;strong&gt;Your Thought:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait...I have plugged into multiple Cisco switches before to create a redundant path and I did not notice anything wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s because by default STP is enabled, to the average person they can plug away and create redundant paths with switches and cause no harm to the network. But if STP has been disabled on those switches or switches that don&#39;t support STP (dumb switches), a Layer 2 loop can occur. A Layer 2 loop is a nightmare if this happens in a production network and can happen in seconds. Loops result in high &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit&#34; title=&#34;Central processing unit&#34;&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt; load on all switches caught in the loop. Because the same frames are constantly being forwarded back and forth between all switches in the loop, the CPU of the switch ends up having to process a lot of data. This slows down performance on the switch when legitimate traffic arrives.  A host caught in a network loop is not accessible to other hosts on the network. Because the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; table is constantly changing with the updates from the broadcast frames, the switch does not know which port to send the unicast frames out to reach the destination. The unicast frames end up looping around the network as well. As more and more frames end up looping on the network, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_radiation&#34; title=&#34;Broadcast radiation&#34;&gt;broadcast storm&lt;/a&gt; occurs. What makes this even more fun is if you try connecting to the switches to solve this problem, good luck :). Most of the time you have to physically turn off the switches to kill the broadcast storm and if it happened once expect it to happen again. To make things worse if any end-devices are connected to the switch ports that are experiencing a broadcast storm they too have a hard time keeping up with the mountain of broadcast frames being sent and sometimes malfunction. Usually you would have to disconnect the switch from the redundant links and apply STP to it and then re-connect the redundant links in order for your network to be broadcast storm free. Although I&#39;m just getting started I think by just introducing this topic will help you better understand it later, I will get into more of this STP magic and how this really helps us design a hierarchy network. Like always I hope this information was informative and if you can&#39;t wait a simple search about STP will help. You can also go right to the source for more STP information at &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; Support and Documentation. Have an idea of the next topic either ICND1 or ICND2 let me know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Configure IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) via SDM</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Awhile back I talked about the differences between IPS and IDS. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/09/cisco-ids-vs-ips/&#34; title=&#34;Cisco IDS vs. IPS&#34;&gt;Cisco IDS vs. IPS&lt;/a&gt; ) So for today&#39;s post let&#39;s learn how to configure an IPS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion prevention system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Prevention System&lt;/a&gt;) on a router using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; SDM (Security Device Manger). The Cisco SDM is a Web-based device management tool a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&#34; title=&#34;Graphical user interface&#34;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; for Cisco &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router&#34; title=&#34;Router&#34;&gt;routers&lt;/a&gt; this can simplify router deployments and cut ownership costs. ( See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/14/configure-cisco-sdm/&#34; title=&#34;Configure Cisco SDM&#34;&gt;Configure Cisco SDM&lt;/a&gt;) Let&#39;s start configuring an IPS with SDM! This tutorial is assuming that the configurations to set up Cisco SDM have already been completed. For this tutorial all we want to focus on is configuring the IPS. Since this using Cisco SDM the IPS wizard is pretty easy to understand. Before we get started I like to have the Cisco SDM preview the commands before I deliver them to the router. To do that at the top of the menu bar click &lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt; and select &lt;em&gt;Preferences&lt;/em&gt; a new window will appear (Like below) and verify that the &lt;em&gt;Preview commands before delivering to the router&lt;/em&gt; is checked.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/20/configuring-zone-based-firewalls-via-sdm/preview_commandse/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/preview_commandse.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM Preferences&#34; title=&#34;Preview_Commands&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Before we even jump into the IPS wizard we must verify that we have the IOS IPS signature package file and the public crypto key. If you don&#39;t have them you then must have a CCO account with Cisco to download them. Make sure that these files are available on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Trivial File Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;TFTP&lt;/a&gt; server installed and running. Put or verify that the IOS IPS signature file is in the default TFTP folder (IOS-Sxxx-CLI.pkg) Remember that the X values will vary depending on the file that was download from Cisco. Also verify that the realm-cisco.pub.key.txt file is available on the computer and note its location. This file is the public key that it used by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS&#34; title=&#34;Cisco IOS&#34;&gt;Cisco IOS&lt;/a&gt; IPS. Once Cisco SDM is opened click the configure button at the top of SDM screen and select &lt;em&gt;Intrusion Prevention&lt;/em&gt; on the left hand side under &lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. Click or verify that the &lt;em&gt;Create IPS&lt;/em&gt; tab is selected and select the &lt;em&gt;Launch IPS Rule Wizard&lt;/em&gt; button. If prompted for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Device_Event_Exchange&#34; title=&#34;Security Device Event Exchange&#34;&gt;SDEE&lt;/a&gt; click ok. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_maine/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_maine.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Main Screen&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Main&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  A window will show, the IPS Welcome Screen which gives the objectives the wizard will go over in helping us create an IPS system.

Click on the three dots button.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_sigfilee/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_sigfilee.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Signature File&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_SigFile&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Another window will open (Specify Signature File) if the signature file is already on the routers flash memory select the first radio button, if the signature file is by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator&#34; title=&#34;Uniform Resource Locator&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; select the correct protocol and address, you can also specify the signature file on the PC. (For this tutorial we are using the TFTP server and are specifying the signature file by URL, once the location of the file has been selected click OK. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_sigfile_spe/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_sigfile_spe.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Signature File Location&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_SigFile_SP&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Now let&#39;s focus on the Public Key, in the name of the public key type realm-cisco.pub or relam-cisco.pub signature. Find and open the realm-cisco.pub.key.txt file and copy (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-C&#34; title=&#34;Control-C&#34;&gt;Ctrl-C&lt;/a&gt;) the text that is between the phrase key-string and the word quit. Paste the text (key) in the key field in the Configure Key section. Click Next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_public_keye/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_public_keye.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Public Key&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Public_Key&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next section (Config Location and Category) wants you to specify where you want the IPS configuration files click on the three dots and choose your location. (For this tutorial we are using flash to store the IPS configuration) Towards the bottom of the screen the wizard wants to choose a signature category for the router. (For this tutorial we are choosing the advanced option.) Click Next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_config_locatione/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_config_locatione.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Config Location&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Config_Location&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next section is the summary window for the IPS configuration, here you can look over the summary to verify the configuration. Click Finish. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_summarye/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_summarye.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Summary&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Summary&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you&#39;ve selected the option to preview commands before delivering them to the router, a final window will appear. In this window you can see the actual commands the SDM program will attempt to deliver. You have the option to save the running-configuration to the startup-configuration after the commands complete. You also have the option to save the configuration as a file and finally you can deliver them to the router. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_delivere/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_delivere.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Deliver&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Deliver&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That&#39;s it! believe it or not that&#39;s the SDM configuration of IOS IPS you can get more information at Cisco&#39;s website about SDM and the configuration settings. Like always I hope this tutorial was informative and if you have a suggestion on the next topic that relates to ICND1 or ICND2 and even some CCNA Security comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/wireless-connection-icon.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/wireless-connection-icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;wireless-connection-icon&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mobility is now a common thing in a business environment, you no longer are fixed to specific cubicle in the work place anymore. What is also amazing is it will continue to change and become easier for employees to get work done, with their phone, tablet, and laptop computer. But what makes this possible? What is the underlying component? The internet is becoming more available in more locations, coffee shops, airports, and your cell phone service provider, with 3G and 4G speeds. Along with the United States of America which is also moving forward with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://broadband.gov/&#34; title=&#34;National Broadband Plan&#34;&gt;National Broadband Plan&lt;/a&gt;. So today let&#39;s explore the wireless concepts!  Wireless can be a scary as you can&#39;t control it. The signal is transmitted in radio waves and if set up insecurely the WLAN (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Wireless LAN&#34;&gt;Wireless Local Area Network&lt;/a&gt;) can easily be your weakest link compared to Ethernet &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network&#34; title=&#34;Local area network&#34;&gt;LANs&lt;/a&gt;. There are four organizations that deal with the wireless standards and products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers&#34; title=&#34;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#34;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; develops the wireless standards (802.11) The IEEE also develops other standards as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-R&#34; title=&#34;ITU-R&#34;&gt;ITU-R&lt;/a&gt; is the worldwide standardization and communications that use and assign different frequencies. This helps you as a consumer if you moved/travel around the world. You are still able to use the 802.11 standard worldwide. Without the need of different devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance&#34; title=&#34;Wi-Fi Alliance&#34;&gt;Wi-Fi Alliance&lt;/a&gt; is an industry that is worldwide that encourages interoperability of products that use WLAN standards to be certified under the Wi-Fi Alliance program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission&#34; title=&#34;Federal Communications Commission&#34;&gt;Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&lt;/a&gt; is the U.S government agency that regulates the usage of various communication frequencies in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are several wireless standards within the 802.11 standard: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n At least for today this post won&#39;t be going over these standards. There is also encryption and security which in not covered in today&#39;s post but will be covered later on. The wireless 802.11 standard can run in two modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad Hoc which uses the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29&#34; title=&#34;Service set (802.11 network)&#34;&gt;independent Basic Service Set&lt;/a&gt; (IBSS) this allows more than two devices to communicate directly with no access point needed or network needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure mode which uses either Basic Service Set (BSS) which uses a single wireless LAN created by one access point and all devices use that access point. Or Extended Service Set (ESS) which uses multiple access points to create one wireless LAN, this allows devices to roam between access points and this covers a larger area compared to the BSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Notice how there can only be one access point if you are using the BSS service set. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/bss/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/bss.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Basic Service Set&#34; title=&#34;BSS&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is an example of an infrastructure mode that uses ESS. Notice how multiple access points can be configured to allow roaming and a lager coverage area. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/ess/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ess.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Extended Service Set&#34; title=&#34;ESS&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Remember that when using wireless it uses the CSMA/CA algorithm the devices must listen to make sure that nobody is transmitting. It will then set a random timer to reduce the change of a collision, when the timer expires the device will listen again, if there is nobody transmitting the device will send the frame. When the frame is sent the device will listen of an acknowledgment from the access point, if no acknowledgment is received then the device will resend the frame but use the CSMA/CA logic. That&#39;s it! At least for now check back later and I&#39;ll talk about the different standards of 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n. I will also go over encryption and some best security practices for wireless LAN networks. I hope this information was informative and if you have any questions, comments or other ICND1 or ICND2 suggestions let me know.&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Collision Domains vs. Broadcast Domains</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/collision-domains-vs.-broadcast-domains/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2011 16:50:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/collision-domains-vs.-broadcast-domains/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;These different types of domains mean different things and when designing a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network&#34; title=&#34;Local area network&#34;&gt;LAN&lt;/a&gt; both of these domains can harm the performance of your network. If you are not aware of the difference between these two, this tutorial should help you out. If you have a small network at your home there is usually the router/modem that is connected via phone line or cable to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider&#34; title=&#34;Internet service provider&#34;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; that router/modem is then connected to a switch or they even have a switch built into the device. You connect a few cables turn on some devices and you now have an internet connection ready to go. In larger networks you have more choices that need to looked at. For example when to use a hub, a switch, or a router and how much money do you want to spend? Usually the more money spent you get more ports, performance increases and more features are added. These are all types of components that need to be thought of when designing a LAN. This tutorial is going to be focusing on two major things collision domains and broadcast domains. The definition of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_domain&#34; title=&#34;Collision domain&#34;&gt;collision domain&lt;/a&gt; is a set of LAN devices whose frames could collide with one another. This happens with hubs, bridges, repeaters and wireless access points as only one device can send and receive. If more than one device tries sending or receiving, the information is lost and irrecoverable it will need to be resent. This can slow down &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_performance&#34; title=&#34;Network performance&#34;&gt;network performance&lt;/a&gt; along with making it a security threat. A hub is considered a layer one device of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt;; all it does is send frames out on all ports including the port in which the frame was received on. This causes a collision domain because only one device can send at the same time. This also shares the bandwidth between of all devices connected to that collision domain. These devices can inefficiently use that bandwidth because of the CSMA/CD and jamming signals that occur when a collision happens.  &lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/hub-domain.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;A Collision Domain with a hub&#34; title=&#34;hub-domain&#34;&gt; A switch uses layer two of the OSI model, so the switch uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC addresses&lt;/a&gt; to send frames to the correct device. Rather than sending it to all ports a switch only sends the frame out one port, if it has the MAC address in its MAC address table. If not the switch will send the frame on all ports except for the port in which the frame was received on. Switches provide separate collision domains on each port, this provides dedicated bandwidth to that device and allows simultaneous conversations between devices on different ports. Each port can be operated at full-duplex so the device can send and receive information at the same time.  &lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/switch-domian.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;A Collision Domain with a switch&#34; title=&#34;switch-domian&#34;&gt; A &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_domain&#34; title=&#34;Broadcast domain&#34;&gt;broadcast domain&lt;/a&gt; is like a collision domain, however the difference is these broadcast domains belong to a set of devices in the same layer two domain. These kind of blur together between a layer three broadcast message and a layer two broadcast message (FFFF:FFFF:FFFF). A layer two broadcast goes to every host in the same LAN/VLAN. To make it little more fun there are two types of layer three broadcast messages :) &lt;strong&gt;Limited/Local Broadcast&lt;/strong&gt; - (255.255.255.255) is often used when the host really has no idea what network its on and waits for a DHCP server to respond back. As well as if a host needs to know the MAC address of a another host on the same LAN/VLAN. This broadcast goes to every host on the same LAN/VLAN and is the most common type of broadcast message. &lt;strong&gt;Directed Broadcast&lt;/strong&gt; - Is a directed IP packet whose destination is a valid broadcast address on the network that the host is not currently a part of. A router would forward this on to the correct network, however this is usually disabled by default. Example 192.168.1.255/24 Also keep in mind when you send a layer three broadcast you&#39;ll also send a layer two broadcast regardless of what type of layer three broadcast message is sent. This also works the other way, when you send a layer two broadcast message you&#39;ll also send a layer three broadcast message. (We work up and down the OSI model) If devices are in the same &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol Suite&#34;&gt;IP network&lt;/a&gt; they will send and receive a broadcast messages and having a smaller broadcast domains can improve network performance as well as improve against security attacks. The more &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt; and network devices connected to a single broadcast domain, the more broadcast messages you will have. A broadcast message goes to every PC that&#39;s on the LAN/VLAN. An example is when the router gets a packet from a different network and that packet is destined to host (192.168.1.124) it will send the packet if the router has the MAC address of 192.168.1.124. If the router does not have the MAC address of (192.168.1.124) in its MAC address table it will send an ARP (Limited/Local Broadcast) request before delivering the packet. In this ARP request the router is basically saying who is 192.168.1.124? and tell me your MAC address. That broadcast message goes to every PC and network device in the broadcast domain. Each PC and network device that is in the 192.168.1.0/24 network has to look at the frame and then discard it if it&#39;s not 192.168.1.124. The PC that is 192.168.1.124 will respond back to the ARP request with an ARP reply. So a broadcast message can just be like a collision domain and affect network performance.&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/broadcast-domain.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;A Broadcast/Collision Domain &#34; title=&#34;broadcast-domain&#34;&gt; To find more information about collision domains and broadcast domains do a simple web search, you will find a lot of information. You can also go to the Cisco Learning &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network&#34; title=&#34;Computer network&#34;&gt;Network&lt;/a&gt; to find that and more information about the networking world. I hope this tutorial was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
