            Networks are becoming more &amp;quot;borderless&amp;quot; as Cisco likes to call it and it&#39;s definitely true. Having the ability to get access to resources remotely without having to be at our office physically is a nice touch, you may even notice higher productivity and who doesn&#39;t want that! Networks have to be in a healthy state in order for people remotely and people at the office to get their work done.

            I&#39;ve found this table that I created a while ago and it lists common WAN connections that businesses use. I have used this table like a reference guide to familiar myself into other protocols. People don&#39;t think of it much but the WAN is a different beast compared the LAN as it uses different protocols besides Ethernet. The WAN or wide area network is what connects us to remote locations within a organization.
