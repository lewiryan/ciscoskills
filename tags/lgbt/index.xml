            A new year, a new plan and a new direction, its been ten years since I started this thing and I have to be honest I loved everything about it. 2020 was crazy... I think were getting close in seeing an ending, but everyone&#39;s life has been affected by this. My work/home life has changed. My priorities have shifted, and because of that this website is going to go static for a while with an unknown date of return.
