          &lt;p&gt;Just when you were getting used to Windows 7, Windows 8 moves into the spotlight. So what do we know about Windows 8? Well from the announcements from CES 2011 it did provide us with more information in what Microsoft plans to do with the Windows platform. So I found some facts, and rumors about the operating system, and it looks pretty interesting so far. From the CES 2011 announcement the next version of Windows will support system-on-a-chip architectures using ARM processors, which means that you should expect Windows to be on a wide range of devices, like tablets. But I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if something more came out of it besides tablets. Also an architectural summit in London last year, Microsoft &amp;quot;hinted&amp;quot; the idea of virtualizing the Windows platform, so apps, data, and Windows settings and maybe parts of the operating system itself will be in the &amp;quot;Cloud.&amp;quot; There is also a rumor that the Windows operating system will have a different user interface codenamed &amp;quot;Wind&amp;quot; for the 64bit OS. It&#39;s hard to tell what the interface would look like but rumors say that this interface would be for high-end devices, like desktops and notebook computers. It also says that the &amp;quot;Wind&amp;quot; interface would require 170MB of video memory and might be in 3D. The rumor also states that the &amp;quot;Wind&amp;quot; interface will be able to adapt to user habits. My guess is Windows will be aware of it surroundings, so if the operating system was outside it would it be easier to see, and programs and icons might change locations, I really don&#39;t know it&#39;s a total guess. :) Some other rumors are that the operating system will be able to follow users wherever they go. So an example would be users would be able to roam between desktops, laptops, and tablets. The programs and files would sync between those devices and the information would be stored on the cloud. There is also a &amp;quot;reset button&amp;quot; rumor that locks in applications and settings while being able to clear viruses and other harmful programs. Some people suggest that storing applications and data in the cloud could make this a possible feature. Another rumor by Paul Thurrott suggests that Windows 8 will introduce a tile based interface called &amp;quot;Mosh&amp;quot; for those tablets and other low powered touchscreens. This would also be interesting feature as although Windows 7 is touch screen supported, it isn&#39;t necessarily touchscreen friendly. When will Windows 8 be released? Multiple rumors suggest that Microsoft is setting a goal for 2012, or early 2013. I&#39;m sure more rumors and facts will become available once we get closer to the release date and I&#39;ll be sure to post additional information, if you find any rumors or added information comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cybercriminals Focusing on Mobile Platforms</title>

          &lt;p&gt;If I were to tell you four years ago that cybercriminals were going to focus on mobile phones instead of computers would you believe me? This shift in focusing on mobile devices and platforms instead of computers means one thing, it’s easier. What does that mean? Well think of it this way if I was hacker wanting to gain access to somebody’s personal information, and I had a choice between their computer or their mobile phone which one would I choose?  Now before I give my answer think of this, computer operating systems like Windows, and Mac have been around for a while so they both have had their share of virus, worms, and trojans especially Windows as it’s a widely and commonly used operating system. Mobile devices like the iPhone, Android and others are relatively new and don’t have much of a security history behind them. Mobile devices especially now can hold a lot of information. Your phone is usually your personal and business phone, all the better to target mobile platforms. So the device I would pick in the end would be the mobile phone. Apple released iOS4 (June 21, 2010) which was said to contain over 60 patches and updates to the device. But one thing that is truly a security threat towards the iPhones, and iPads and other iOS devices is “jailbreaking”. This unlocks the software so the user can download additional applications, extensions and themes that are unavailable through the official App Store (which is software approved by Apple). In the United States jailbreaking is legal and does not violate copyright laws. Since then more than million users have jailbroken their iPhones. (According to Electronic Frontier Foundation) Software that is installed and not approved by Apple could be a security risk by creating the potential of sensitive data leaks, and viruses.  What about Android? One thing that is different from Android is it’s a flexible operating system. Meaning it’s already on smartphones and tablets but plans to have the software in cars, and other devices.  The growth of this open source software and the number of users makes this operating system attractive to developers along with hackers. Since Android is open source unlike Apple people can have access to the source code, including potential attackers. This makes it easier for attackers to put up rouge applications and viruses. One thing you can do to protect yourself is to be aware of the types of apps you download. To me it seems like people think or are simply unaware that viruses and harmful software can be installed on your mobile phone or device, just like if you were on computer. If it’s a third-party application not on the Android or Apple marketplace be especially careful. There is also anti-virus software for your phone if you want another layer of added protection. The last thing is if you have an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) don’t jailbreak it!  Apple will likely end your user license agreement and you run the risk of viruses, faulty programs and even hardware failures.&lt;/p&gt;
