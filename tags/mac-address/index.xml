          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/network-cables.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/network-cables.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;network cables&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let&#39;s start the New Year with understanding &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherChannel&#34; title=&#34;EtherChannel&#34;&gt;EtherChannel&lt;/a&gt; which is having more than one link connected to a server, switch, or router and treating it like one logical link. This is a fault-tolerant technique that is becoming a common setup in highly available, core devices. Cisco has come up with their own proprietary version call EtherChannel. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard&#34; title=&#34;Open standard&#34;&gt;open standard&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers&#34; title=&#34;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#34;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; approved is 802.3ad which works with other venders and is often called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation&#34; title=&#34;Link aggregation&#34;&gt;LAG&lt;/a&gt; for short. Why would I use EtherChannel? One big benefit is bandwidth you can combine up to eight parallel links and depending on the port speed and the physical cable you could in theory get up to 80 Gbit/s per second! (Using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFP_transceiver&#34; title=&#34;Small form-factor Pluggable Transceiver&#34;&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt;+ links which can get up 10G a piece in theory) Etherchannel aggregates traffic across all available active ports which make it look like one logical cable. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/01/04/basic-understanding-of-etherchannel/etherchannele-2/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/etherchannele1.png&#34; alt=&#34;EtherChannel between Switches&#34; title=&#34;EtherChannel&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although this sounds wonderful and it is there are some things to keep in mind. EtherChannel does not always distribute the traffic equally across all available links it depends on the number of links you have connected but even that does not always guarantee equal traffic. EtherChannel hands-out values 0-7 (that&#39;s why you can only have up to eight links) on each link. Some of those links may have more than one value assigned to them this makes balancing the traffic not always equal. So looking at the table below if we were using five physical links and every link was in theory in perfect distribution three of those links would be receiving twice as much traffic than the other two links. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/01/04/basic-understanding-of-etherchannel/etherchannel-tablee/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/etherchannel-tablee.png&#34; alt=&#34;EtherChannel Physical Link Balancing&#34; title=&#34;EtherChannel Table&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If every link was in perfect distribution you could have physical links of two, four, or eight. But this depends on the usage of a particular device because Etherchannel does not load balance between physical links if one link becomes oversaturated it will drop packets. Etherchannel can look at the following methods to decide which &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Physical Layer&#34;&gt;physical link&lt;/a&gt; to send data over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destination MAC address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source and destination MAC address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destination IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source and destination IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_port&#34; title=&#34;Source port&#34;&gt;source port&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destination port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source and destination port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these methods depend on the hardware and software you are running but they will put a value between 0-7 on each connected link. Remember each link can have more than one value assigned to it. I hope this information is helpful and you are welcome to ask questions or comment. Also post some ideas that you would like to see posted that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/network-cable-color.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/network-cable-color.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Network-Cable-Color&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Switching in the network can happen in two ways, these layer-two devices send frames but they can forward them in different ways. These different modes have positive and negative effects which depend on the type of network environment that runs through them! Store-and-forward is just like the name suggests, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch&#34; title=&#34;Network switch&#34;&gt;switch&lt;/a&gt; receives a frame on a port and stores the frame in it&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer&#34; title=&#34;Data buffer&#34;&gt;memory buffer&lt;/a&gt; until the frame has been completely received. The switch analyzes the frame for information about its destination and uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check&#34; title=&#34;Cyclic redundancy check&#34;&gt;CRC&lt;/a&gt; (cyclic redundancy check) a mathematical formula based on the number  of 1 bits in the frame to decide whether the frame has an error. After confirming its integrity the frame is forward out the correct port and toward its destination. If a frame is corrupted the switch discards it and less bandwidth is wasted on the unusable frame. Some other useful information about store and forward switching is it is required for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service&#34; title=&#34;Quality of service&#34;&gt;QoS (Quality of  Service)&lt;/a&gt;. Cut-through switching acts on the data as soon as it is received, even if the transmission is not complete! The switch only buffers enough of the frame to read the destination &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; so that it can then decide were to  send the frame. This is located in the first 6 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte&#34; title=&#34;Byte&#34;&gt;bytes&lt;/a&gt; of the frame. The switch looks at the MAC address in its own MAC address table and starts to forward the frame.  The switch does not perform any &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction&#34; title=&#34;Error detection and correction&#34;&gt;error checking&lt;/a&gt; on the frame because it can start forwarding the frame immediately after the first 6 bytes. Cut-through switching is faster than &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_and_forward&#34; title=&#34;Store and forward&#34;&gt;store-and-forward&lt;/a&gt; but because there is no error checking if there is corrupt frames the switch forwards them into the network using up bandwidth the end device would eventually discard the frame. There is also another type of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-through_switching&#34; title=&#34;Cut-through switching&#34;&gt;cut-through switching&lt;/a&gt; which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_free&#34; title=&#34;Fragment free&#34;&gt;fragment-free&lt;/a&gt; switching.  This is the best of both worlds, it stores the first 64 bytes of the frame Why only 64 bytes? Most problems occur at the first 64 bytes of the frame like collisions. The switch tries to enhance cut-through by using a small error check and then forwards the frame. That&#39;s my post about these methods of switching both are good and bad depending on the network environment. Like always I hope this information is helpful and ff you have an idea of the next topic either ICND1 or ICND2  let me know by posting a comment below. Questions? go ahead and post them!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;In the month of August I talked about the &amp;quot;beginnings&amp;quot; of layer two &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_%28engineering%29&#34; title=&#34;Redundancy (engineering)&#34;&gt;redundancy&lt;/a&gt; mainly looking at the basic foundations and fundamentals of having layer two redundancy. Let&#39;s continue are discussion about redundancy in the layer two environment. To review what STP does (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Spanning Tree Protocol&#34;&gt;Spanning Tree Protocol&lt;/a&gt;) it works at layer two of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt;. If more than one path is available in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Network Layer&#34;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; the STP algorithm basically shutdowns the redundant links until the active link is unavailable (shutdown, disabled, etc.) So although there are multiple links connected physically to offer redundancy, logically the switches in the network only see one path that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet frame&#34;&gt;Ethernet frame&lt;/a&gt; can travel. Remember without STP networks would be on the fritz when we introduce redundancy in the environment. STP or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1D&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.1D&#34;&gt;IEEE 802.1D&lt;/a&gt; is an open standard so it is not just on Cisco equipment but others as well which helps in a multivendor situation. So how does looping occur without the use STP? Looking at the picture below we can see the broadcasts frames are flooding the network which is by design but the thing that changes is these broadcasts will continue to flood the network because there is on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live&#34; title=&#34;Time to live&#34;&gt;TTL&lt;/a&gt; (Time-To-Live) on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Link_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Data Link Layer&#34;&gt;data link layer&lt;/a&gt; of the OSI model. As more packets are passed and created the network will become slower and slower and eventually devices on the network will become unavailable this called a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_radiation&#34; title=&#34;Broadcast radiation&#34;&gt;broadcast storm&lt;/a&gt;. [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1534&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;584&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;STP Loop Example (Broadcast Storm)&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stpfl.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stpfl.png&#34; alt=&#34;An example of an STP loop&#34; title=&#34;STP Loop&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] There are also more problems when not using STP besides broadcast storms like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; table becoming unstable in each switch. This causes the MAC table to be unreliable because of the looping frames in the network. These frames are usually sent to the wrong locations in the network. Multiple frames can also be a problem because of looping frames multiple frames appear on the network and if they are delivered to the intended host it can confuse the host and more likly drop the frames. So looking at the same picture but with STP enabled we can see that broadcast frame will travel the network without looping. On S1 one of the ports is in a blocking state and blocks all traffic coming into that port and traffic coming out of that port. [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1539&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;584&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;STP Enabled&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/09/07/the-middle-of-layer-two-redundancy/stp-enable/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stp-enable.png&#34; alt=&#34;STP Enabled&#34; title=&#34;STP Enable&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] The magic about STP is when the link between S2 and S3 becomes disconnected it will bring the link between S2 and S1 online and continue to send packets! When the link becomes available again it switch back to blocking on S1. So let&#39;s stop there for now and check back next week to see the last chapter of STP, how does it calculate which switch goes to blocking? What other advantages does STP offer? That&#39;s all next week, I hope this information is helpful and if you have an idea of the next topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me hear it!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/network-diagram.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/network-diagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;network-diagram&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In a perfect world we would never need redundancy on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Network Layer&#34;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure, but as you know as well as I know we don&#39;t live in a perfect world. Hardware will eventually fail, bottlenecks will appear, and the speed of our network will become slower when we max the bandwidth on links. So having redundancy in routers, connections, and having a hierarchy network is one of best choices to make when improving the efficiently of the network. But in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt; there is one layer that can&#39;t have redundancy at least logically and that is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer&#34; title=&#34;Abstraction layer&#34;&gt;Layer&lt;/a&gt; two of the OSI model. If you follow this blog way back when I talked about the OSI model, layer two belongs to the switches and by design the ethernet frame does not support a TTL (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live&#34; title=&#34;Time to live&#34;&gt;Time-To-Live&lt;/a&gt;) like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol&#34;&gt;IP packet&lt;/a&gt;. So bring forth STP, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Spanning Tree Protocol&#34;&gt;Spanning Tree Protocol&lt;/a&gt; which works at layer two of the OSI model. If more than one path is available in the network the STP algorithm basically shutdowns the redundant links until active link is unavailable (shutdown, disabled, etc.) So although there are multiple links connected physically to offer redundancy, logically the switches in the network only see one path that ethernet frame can travel. &lt;strong&gt;Your Thought:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait...I have plugged into multiple Cisco switches before to create a redundant path and I did not notice anything wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s because by default STP is enabled, to the average person they can plug away and create redundant paths with switches and cause no harm to the network. But if STP has been disabled on those switches or switches that don&#39;t support STP (dumb switches), a Layer 2 loop can occur. A Layer 2 loop is a nightmare if this happens in a production network and can happen in seconds. Loops result in high &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit&#34; title=&#34;Central processing unit&#34;&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt; load on all switches caught in the loop. Because the same frames are constantly being forwarded back and forth between all switches in the loop, the CPU of the switch ends up having to process a lot of data. This slows down performance on the switch when legitimate traffic arrives.  A host caught in a network loop is not accessible to other hosts on the network. Because the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; table is constantly changing with the updates from the broadcast frames, the switch does not know which port to send the unicast frames out to reach the destination. The unicast frames end up looping around the network as well. As more and more frames end up looping on the network, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_radiation&#34; title=&#34;Broadcast radiation&#34;&gt;broadcast storm&lt;/a&gt; occurs. What makes this even more fun is if you try connecting to the switches to solve this problem, good luck :). Most of the time you have to physically turn off the switches to kill the broadcast storm and if it happened once expect it to happen again. To make things worse if any end-devices are connected to the switch ports that are experiencing a broadcast storm they too have a hard time keeping up with the mountain of broadcast frames being sent and sometimes malfunction. Usually you would have to disconnect the switch from the redundant links and apply STP to it and then re-connect the redundant links in order for your network to be broadcast storm free. Although I&#39;m just getting started I think by just introducing this topic will help you better understand it later, I will get into more of this STP magic and how this really helps us design a hierarchy network. Like always I hope this information was informative and if you can&#39;t wait a simple search about STP will help. You can also go right to the source for more STP information at &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; Support and Documentation. Have an idea of the next topic either ICND1 or ICND2 let me know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding VTP</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/11/understanding-vtp/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Some people hate it, some people love it. It&#39;s the Cisco proprietary &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN_Trunking_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;VLAN Trunking Protocol&#34;&gt;VLAN Trunking Protocol&lt;/a&gt; (VTP) which in short means that Cisco switches can exchange VLAN configuration, instead of manually configuring each switch with the same &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Virtual LAN&#34;&gt;VLANs&lt;/a&gt;. I also suggest if you don&#39;t know what a VLAN is check out the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/01/creating-vlans/&#34; title=&#34;Creating VLANs&#34;&gt;Creating VLANs&lt;/a&gt; Let&#39;s get right into understanding VTP. The thing that makes VTP shine is what it does, although simple to understand it saves time by automatically distributing VLAN information. Take for example if you had 20 switches that need the same VLANs you could do it manually but this runs the risk of human error, with VTP if you configure one switch as a server and all other switches as clients then you can configure all of them. VTP uses Layer two messages to exchange information if a server switch changes or removes VLANS VTP will synchronize all switches so all switches have the same VLANs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/11/understanding-vtp/vlan_trunking_protocol_/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vlan_trunking_protocol_.gif?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;VLAN Trunking Protocol&#34; title=&#34;VLAN_Trunking_Protocol&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The VTP server distributes VLAN configuration changes through VTP messages, sent over &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Inter-Switch_Link&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Inter-Switch Link&#34;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.1Q&#34;&gt;802.1Q&lt;/a&gt; trunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISL is an older technology along with being Cisco proprietary. ISL also fully encapsulates the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet&#34;&gt;original Ethernet&lt;/a&gt; frame inside the ISL header remain unchanged. Along with using the source and destination &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC addresses&lt;/a&gt; in the ISL header to send and receiving to a switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.1Q is an open-standard created by IEEE and uses a different header than ISL to tag frames, with the VLAN number. 802.1Q does not encapsulate the original frame into another &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet frame&#34;&gt;Ethernet header&lt;/a&gt; and trailer. 802.1Q inserts and extra 4-byte VLAN header into the original frame&#39;s Ethernet header. The frame still has the original source and destination MAC address unlike ISL. Also because the original header has been expanded 802.1Q forces a FCS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_check_sequence&#34; title=&#34;Frame check sequence&#34;&gt;Frame check sequence&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default when a switch is powered on the VTP mode is server, VTP servers and clients can choose whether to react to the received VTP update, by either update their VLAN configuration or ignore it. This is based on the VLAN database configuration revision number. Each time the VTP server modifies its VLAN configuration the VTP server increments the current configuration revision number by 1. If the revision number increases and is higher than a client switch or server switch, it will update its VLAN database. This is where VTP can destroy your network if set up incorrectly or not securely. If you have a &amp;quot;rouge&amp;quot; VTP server that has a higher revision number then the other VTP server, all switches in the domain including the VTP server will change and update the VLAN configuration based on the &amp;quot;rouge&amp;quot; VTP server. There are three VTP Modes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server Mode, Servers can create VLANs and distribute VLAN configuration changes through VTP messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client Mode, Clients cannot be used to configure VLAN information they only learn about VLANs by VTP servers and only forward VTP messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent Mode, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28computing%29&#34; title=&#34;Transparency (computing)&#34;&gt;Transparent mode&lt;/a&gt; switches never update their VLAN database on incoming VTP messages. Like servers they can however create VLANs, they also will send VTP messages to help out other switches in server or client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VTP defines three message types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary advertisements - list the revision number, domain name, and other information but no VLAN information. These are summary advertisements that occur every 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subset advertisements - occur when a new a larger revision number is introduced which is some subset of the VLAN database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request message - Allows the switch to immediately request VTP messages from a neighboring switch as soon as a trunk comes up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VTP does have some other features like VTP Pruning, passwords protection and domains but that all in the configuration side. An interesting side note is that VTP cannot be turned off. There is no disable command in the switch IOS, if you want to turn off VTP on a switch change the mode to transparent. You can find additional information about VTP at Cisco.com along with a web search. Like always I hope this information was informative and if you have a topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know by commenting below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Configuring Port Security</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/31/configuring-port-security/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2011 16:00:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/31/configuring-port-security/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/lock.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/lock.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Secure&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today this tutorial is going to be talking about how to configure &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_security&#34; title=&#34;Port security&#34;&gt;port security&lt;/a&gt; on a Cisco &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst_switch&#34; title=&#34;Catalyst switch&#34;&gt;Catalyst switch&lt;/a&gt;. Port security is one of the first things you can do to keep your network secure from unauthorized access. Port security can restrict devices so only devices you allow are granted access to network resources. If and when an unauthorized device is connected to a port you can decide what you want the switch to do. Let&#39;s get started!  There are three different settings you can configure with port security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect which discards the traffic but keeps the port up and does not send a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Simple Network Management Protocol&#34;&gt;SNMP&lt;/a&gt; message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict which discards the traffic and sends a SNMP message but keeps the port up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shutdown which discards the traffic sends a SNMP message and disables the port. (This is the default behavior is no setting is specified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before setting up port security some steps need to be completed before we can set it up correctly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must make the switch interface an access interface by using the &lt;strong&gt;switchport mode access&lt;/strong&gt; command. This can be applied in a range of the interfaces on a switch or individual interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must enable port security by using the &lt;strong&gt;switchport port-security&lt;/strong&gt; command. This can be applied in a range of the interfaces on a switch or individual interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This step is optional, but you can specify how many &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC addresses&lt;/a&gt; the switch can have on one interface at a time. If this setting is not applied the default of one MAC address is used. The command to configure this is as follows, &lt;strong&gt;swithcport port-security maximum&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; (where X can be from 1 to 6272) Keep in mind the range the number of maximum MAC address depends on the hardware and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS&#34; title=&#34;Cisco IOS&#34;&gt;Cisco IOS&lt;/a&gt; you use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This step is optional, but you can define the action to take when a violation occurs on that interface or interfaces. The default is to shut down the interface or interfaces. The command to configure this is as follows &lt;strong&gt;switch port-security violation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;{ protect | restrict | shutdown }&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can specify the MAC address that is allowed to access the network resources manually by using the command &lt;strong&gt;switchport port-security mac-address&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;value of MAC address&lt;/em&gt;. Use this command multiple times if you want more than one MAC address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to be lazy and not enter every single MAC address in your organization then you can have the switch learn the MAC address by learning it with the sticky command. You would use this command as follows &lt;strong&gt;switchport port-security mac-address sticky&lt;/strong&gt;. This will learn the first MAC address that comes into on the interface or interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below output is an example of configuring port security on a range of ports fa0/1 - 10, for this example the maximum MAC addresses I want on one port is two, I also want the violation to change from the default setting to restrict. Finally instead of manually configuring the ports with a MAC addresses I am going to have the switch learn them with the sticky command. [code]Switch&amp;gt;enable Switch#configure terminal Switch(config)#interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 10 Switch(config-if-range)#switchport port-security maximum 2 Switch(config-if-range)#switchport port-security violation restrict Switch(config-if-range)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky Switch(config-if-range)#exit Switch(config)#exit Switch# %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console[/code] That&#39;s it! Port security is a good step in keeping only authorized devices connected to the network, but keep in mind there are plenty more security options that need to be taken into consideration. To find more information about port security like a web search will do, along with checking with Cisco documentation at Cisco.com. I hope this tutorial is helpful and please comment below for suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Collision Domains vs. Broadcast Domains</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/30/collision-domains-vs.-broadcast-domains/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2011 16:50:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/30/collision-domains-vs.-broadcast-domains/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;These different types of domains mean different things and when designing a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network&#34; title=&#34;Local area network&#34;&gt;LAN&lt;/a&gt; both of these domains can harm the performance of your network. If you are not aware of the difference between these two, this tutorial should help you out. If you have a small network at your home there is usually the router/modem that is connected via phone line or cable to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider&#34; title=&#34;Internet service provider&#34;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; that router/modem is then connected to a switch or they even have a switch built into the device. You connect a few cables turn on some devices and you now have an internet connection ready to go. In larger networks you have more choices that need to looked at. For example when to use a hub, a switch, or a router and how much money do you want to spend? Usually the more money spent you get more ports, performance increases and more features are added. These are all types of components that need to be thought of when designing a LAN. This tutorial is going to be focusing on two major things collision domains and broadcast domains. The definition of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_domain&#34; title=&#34;Collision domain&#34;&gt;collision domain&lt;/a&gt; is a set of LAN devices whose frames could collide with one another. This happens with hubs, bridges, repeaters and wireless access points as only one device can send and receive. If more than one device tries sending or receiving, the information is lost and irrecoverable it will need to be resent. This can slow down &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_performance&#34; title=&#34;Network performance&#34;&gt;network performance&lt;/a&gt; along with making it a security threat. A hub is considered a layer one device of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt;; all it does is send frames out on all ports including the port in which the frame was received on. This causes a collision domain because only one device can send at the same time. This also shares the bandwidth between of all devices connected to that collision domain. These devices can inefficiently use that bandwidth because of the CSMA/CD and jamming signals that occur when a collision happens.  &lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/hub-domain.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;A Collision Domain with a hub&#34; title=&#34;hub-domain&#34;&gt; A switch uses layer two of the OSI model, so the switch uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC addresses&lt;/a&gt; to send frames to the correct device. Rather than sending it to all ports a switch only sends the frame out one port, if it has the MAC address in its MAC address table. If not the switch will send the frame on all ports except for the port in which the frame was received on. Switches provide separate collision domains on each port, this provides dedicated bandwidth to that device and allows simultaneous conversations between devices on different ports. Each port can be operated at full-duplex so the device can send and receive information at the same time.  &lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/switch-domian.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;A Collision Domain with a switch&#34; title=&#34;switch-domian&#34;&gt; A &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_domain&#34; title=&#34;Broadcast domain&#34;&gt;broadcast domain&lt;/a&gt; is like a collision domain, however the difference is these broadcast domains belong to a set of devices in the same layer two domain. These kind of blur together between a layer three broadcast message and a layer two broadcast message (FFFF:FFFF:FFFF). A layer two broadcast goes to every host in the same LAN/VLAN. To make it little more fun there are two types of layer three broadcast messages :) &lt;strong&gt;Limited/Local Broadcast&lt;/strong&gt; - (255.255.255.255) is often used when the host really has no idea what network its on and waits for a DHCP server to respond back. As well as if a host needs to know the MAC address of a another host on the same LAN/VLAN. This broadcast goes to every host on the same LAN/VLAN and is the most common type of broadcast message. &lt;strong&gt;Directed Broadcast&lt;/strong&gt; - Is a directed IP packet whose destination is a valid broadcast address on the network that the host is not currently a part of. A router would forward this on to the correct network, however this is usually disabled by default. Example 192.168.1.255/24 Also keep in mind when you send a layer three broadcast you&#39;ll also send a layer two broadcast regardless of what type of layer three broadcast message is sent. This also works the other way, when you send a layer two broadcast message you&#39;ll also send a layer three broadcast message. (We work up and down the OSI model) If devices are in the same &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol Suite&#34;&gt;IP network&lt;/a&gt; they will send and receive a broadcast messages and having a smaller broadcast domains can improve network performance as well as improve against security attacks. The more &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt; and network devices connected to a single broadcast domain, the more broadcast messages you will have. A broadcast message goes to every PC that&#39;s on the LAN/VLAN. An example is when the router gets a packet from a different network and that packet is destined to host (192.168.1.124) it will send the packet if the router has the MAC address of 192.168.1.124. If the router does not have the MAC address of (192.168.1.124) in its MAC address table it will send an ARP (Limited/Local Broadcast) request before delivering the packet. In this ARP request the router is basically saying who is 192.168.1.124? and tell me your MAC address. That broadcast message goes to every PC and network device in the broadcast domain. Each PC and network device that is in the 192.168.1.0/24 network has to look at the frame and then discard it if it&#39;s not 192.168.1.124. The PC that is 192.168.1.124 will respond back to the ARP request with an ARP reply. So a broadcast message can just be like a collision domain and affect network performance.&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/broadcast-domain.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;A Broadcast/Collision Domain &#34; title=&#34;broadcast-domain&#34;&gt; To find more information about collision domains and broadcast domains do a simple web search, you will find a lot of information. You can also go to the Cisco Learning &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network&#34; title=&#34;Computer network&#34;&gt;Network&lt;/a&gt; to find that and more information about the networking world. I hope this tutorial was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;This tutorial will be going over the basic information of how a router routes &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol&#34;&gt;IP packets&lt;/a&gt;. Routers are used in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI layer&lt;/a&gt; three or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Network Layer&#34;&gt;network layer&lt;/a&gt;. These routers have IP addresses and forward IP packets to the proper destination. This guide is somewhat basic and is assuming you have some information of how &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP addressing&lt;/a&gt; works and along with what routing protocols are. So let&#39;s focus first on how a host or a computer forwards traffic and then look at how a router forwards traffic. Computers forward or send packets based on these two steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the destination IP address is in the same network or subnet as PC-1 then send the packet directly to that host (without the routers help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If PC-1 does not have the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; to the destination host (PC-2) then it will send an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Address Resolution Protocol&#34;&gt;ARP&lt;/a&gt; request to get the MAC address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/16/how-a-router-routes/arp-message/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/arp-message.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;ARP Message (Broadcast)&#34; title=&#34;ARP-Message&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/arp-message.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For example PC-1 (192.168.1.1) is trying to send to PC-2 (192.1681.2) since both of these computers are on the same network, (PC-1 checks the destination &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork&#34; title=&#34;Subnetwork&#34;&gt;subnet mask&lt;/a&gt; and IP address to see if they are on the same network which they are) if PC-1 knows the MAC address of PC-2 it will put the IP address of PC-2 in the destination address field along with other information not related to this tutorial and forward the packet. If PC-1 does not know the MAC address it will send and ARP request, what this request does is send a broadcast message to all other &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt; and devices connected on the 192.168.1.0 network. This message wants to find the MAC address of the host connected to 192.168.1.2, once PC-2 gets the message it will send its MAC address to PC-1. PC-1 will then forward the packet to PC-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the destination IP address is not in the same subnet or network has PC-1 then PC-1 will send the packet to its default gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If PC-1 does not have the MAC address to the default gateway (R1) then send a ARP request to get the MAC address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example PC-1 (192.168.1.1) is trying to send to R1 (192.168.1.254) because the packet is not in the same network, PC-1&#39;s main goal is to send to a webserver (154.63.2.1) (PC-1 checks the destination subnet mask and IP address to see if they are on the same network which they are not) if PC-1 knows the MAC address of R1 it will put the IP address of R1 in the destination address field along with other information not related to this tutorial, and forward the packet. If PC-1 does not know the MAC address it will send and ARP request, what this request does is send a broadcast message to all other PCs and devices connected on the 192.168.1.0 network. This message wants to find the MAC address of the host connected to 192.168.1.254, once R1 gets the message it will send its MAC address to PC-1. PC-1 will then forward the packet/frame. Once the frame is received by R1 the router will first check the data-link FCS field. If the frame received errors the router will drop the packet. If the frame has no errors the router will rip off the old data link header and trailer and then look at the IP packet. The router then compares the IP packet&#39;s destination address. If the router has the IP address in its routing table the router will encapsulate the IP packet inside a new data link layer header and trailer and forward it out the correct interface, thus forwarding the frame. Confusued? Let&#39;s go into some more detail of what happened. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/16/how-a-router-routes/route-example/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/route-example.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Route-Example&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Looking at the topology PC-1 wants to send a packet to the web server. Since the web server is not on PC-1&#39;s network it will need to send the packet to its default gateway which is R1. PC-1 will build an IP packet with the destination IP address of the web server (154.63.2.1). PC-1 sends this has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet frame&#34;&gt;Ethernet frame&lt;/a&gt; with the destination IP address of R1 and has the MAC address of R1. R1 receives the frame and because the MAC address matches R1, the router will copy the frame and process it. R1 checks the FCS and no errors have occurred, next the router will then discard the old Ethernet header and trailer. R1 will compare the address and see if it has a match in its routing table; if there is not match the router will drop the frame. However the router finds an entry in its table to (154.63.2.1) the frame is forwarded out the router serial interface. The router encapsulates the packet and forwards out serial interface in an HDLC frame towards the next router. This will repeat the same steps in each router as along as the routers have a route to that destination it will then eventually be received by the router connected to the web server. This router will send an ARP message that wants to know who is 154.63.2.1? That broadcast message will be received by all devices connected to the 154.63.2.0 network. The web server will respond and send the MAC address to the router and the router will then forward the packet to the web server. That&#39;s the basic understanding of how routers forward traffic, this tutorial only scratched the surface with how routers route along with keeping it simple some things were skipped in this tutorial. If you would like to find more information take a look at Cisco.com which is a great place to get started. Questions or comments are also welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cracking WEP</title>

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackTrack&#34; title=&#34;BackTrack&#34;&gt;BackTrack&lt;/a&gt; is Linux  &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security&#34; title=&#34;Network security&#34;&gt;network security&lt;/a&gt; audit tool for security professionals. This tool is used for testing and penetrating networks. That being said** This tutorial is for educational use only. This is meant only to teach that WEP is an insecure option, and is recommend to use a harder encryption. Using this tutorial on a network that you do not have permission to access or is not yours, could be illegal! ** This was tested on BackTrack version 4 and the steps outlined in this tutorial were successful. (this tutorial is assuming that you have BackTrack 4 installed and are ready with a shell prompt)  The first thing you want to do is start your wireless interface in most cases this is wlan0 [code]airmon-ng start wlan0[/code] In the output look for the monitor interface in most cases this is mon0   The next thing you want to do is copy down the target AP&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29&#34; title=&#34;Service set (802.11 network)&#34;&gt;ESSID&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; of the AP,  also copy down the channel of the target AP.  [code]airodump-ng mon0[/code] There must be a client or clients using the AP if not you can&#39;t crack it. Match the MAC address of the AP to the available clients you have listed.   Next only output what you want (for example I have an AP on channel 8 and that MAC address of the AP is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and it&#39;s out monitor 0) the command would be:       [code]airodump-ng --channel 8 --write output --bssid 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 mon0[/code] (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is you want to associate your wireless card with the AP(for example I have the AP&#39;s MAC and ESSID (which is test) and my wireless MAC address (which is aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -1 0 -e test -a 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is start the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_injection&#34; title=&#34;Packet injection&#34;&gt;packet injection&lt;/a&gt; (for example you will need the target AP&#39;s MAC address (which is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and my(yours) wireless MAC address (which is 00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h 00:55:bb:DD:FF mon0[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The final step depends were the outputs are saved and the name of the output (for this example they were on /root and the name of the file was output-01.cap) so the command would look like:     [code]aircrack-ng output-01.cap[/code] Again this depends were the file was saved it could be in a different location. But after that command aircrack will attempt to crack the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy&#34; title=&#34;Wired Equivalent Privacy&#34;&gt;WEP key&lt;/a&gt; it will tell you that it either failed or if it was able to find it. (If it does fail wait for more packets and try again.)   The way aircrack works is that it reads the packet injection file, (this file is continues to update as packets move across the network) aircrack then finds the common key because that key is sent back and forth in the network. Depending on how active the network is aircrack is able to find the key in less than a minute!   Keep in mind when I was setting this up on a test AP I did run into some difficulties, although cracking a WEP key is relatively easy it still took me some time in troubleshooting. I hope this tutorial is helpful, you can find more information at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&lt;/a&gt; Also check my tutorial on &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/&#34; title=&#34;Install BackTrack&#34;&gt;Installing BackTrack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
