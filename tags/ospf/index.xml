          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/routing_updates.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/routing_updates.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Routing_Updates&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We have to start somewhere so let’s look at the basics of configuring OSPF. Remember OSPF is an IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) and allows packet authentication as well as IP multicast when sending and receiving updates. In this post we are configuring OSPF in a single area. In this topology we have four routers and two PCs. The PCs subnet are 172.30.2.0/24 and 172.30.3.0/24. We have point to point connections between each router. [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3313&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ospf-topo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ospf-topo.png&#34; alt=&#34;4 Node OSPF Single Area &#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 4 Node OSPF Single Area[/caption] So we have already configured all of interfaces and everything seems good but PC1 can’t ping PC2 and vice versa. If we do a &lt;strong&gt;show ip route&lt;/strong&gt; on R1 we can see that R1 does not know about the 172.30.2.x or 172.30.3.x network as well as any other network not directly connected to R1. [code]R1#show ip route Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP a - application route + - replicated route, % - next hop override Gateway of last resort is not set 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 6 subnets, 2 masks C 172.16.0.8/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 L 172.16.0.9/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 L 172.16.0.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.16.128.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 L 172.16.128.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets C 192.168.0.1 is directly connected, Loopback0 [/code] We also see the same issue with R3, if a routing protocol is not configured on router it will only know about its own active networks. [code]R3#show ip route Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP a - application route + - replicated route, % - next hop override Gateway of last resort is not set 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 6 subnets, 2 masks C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 L 172.16.0.14/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.16.128.4/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 L 172.16.128.6/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 C 172.16.128.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 L 172.16.128.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 172.30.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks C 172.30.3.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 L 172.30.3.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets C 192.168.0.3 is directly connected, Loopback0 [/code] To configure OSPF you can do this in two ways. Let’s look at the traditional way to configure OSPF by jumping into to R1 and in the configuration mode let’s enter &lt;strong&gt;router ospf 1&lt;/strong&gt; followed by enter. &lt;em&gt;(NOTE: 1 is the process ID for OSPF you if you don’t what to use 1 we can pick between 1-65535, also this does not have match on each router).&lt;/em&gt; We are now under a config-router prompt, the next thing we want to do is to tell the router what IP interface you want OSPF to run on. Looking at the network topology R1 has three interfaces let’s first choose the interface that uses the IP address 172.16.0.9 and put it in area 0. &lt;em&gt;(Remember wildcard subnet masks)&lt;/em&gt; [code]R1(config)#router ospf 1 R1(config-router)#network 172.16.0.9 0.0.0.0 area 0 [/code] &lt;strong&gt;“(Side Conversation)&lt;/strong&gt; Area 0 is used for single-area configuration, you don’t have to use area 0 but it is recommended because Area 0 is special and not like the rest. If you ever needed two OSPF areas and they need to share routes together it won’t work without area 0 in the environment. Re-configuring a routing protocol on production may not be a good idea :). Another question that comes up when using the network command is why did I match the specific interface of 172.16.0.9? (&lt;strong&gt;network 172.16.0.9 0.0.0.0&lt;/strong&gt; ) Remember when we configure OSPF using the network command we are specifically looking at the individual interface of which we want OSPF sending and receiving updates. This is where it gets confusing because this command is not telling the router what to advertise it is simply telling the router which interfaces that you want OSPF running on. You could use the “lazy method” and allow all and future interfaces that the router has to use OSPF by using the command: &lt;strong&gt;network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255&lt;/strong&gt;. However this is a catch-22 because you are no longer in control of what interfaces that OSPF is running along with what networks are being added to OSPF. Future interfaces you configure on the router will be added to OSPF automatically and you may not want that. Personally and its a best practice to match the specific interfaces instead of using the “lazy method**.”** So what just happened? Well nothing yet because R1 is this only router sending OSPF updates so let’s jump to R2 and run the following under the config-router prompt. [code]R2(config)#router ospf 1 R2(config-router)#network 172.16.0.10 0.0.0.0 area 0 R2(config-router)# *Aug 13 01:49:33.888: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.0.1 on GigabitEthernet0/1 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done [/code] Notice the OSPF Adjacency that came up, this is good news because we now have OSPF running between R1 and R2 and they are exchanging updates between each other. We can verify this up looking at **show ip ospf neighbor**. [code]R1#show ip ospf neighbor Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface 192.168.0.2 1 FULL/BDR 00:00:30 172.16.0.10 GigabitEthernet0/1 [/code] Let’s get PC 2’s network advertised as well as all of the remaining interfaces on R1 and R2. [code]R2(config)#router ospf 1 R2(config-router)#network 172.30.2.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 R2(config-router)#network 172.16.128.9 0.0.0.0 area 0 R2(config-router)#network 172.16.128.5 0.0.0.0 area 0 R1(config)#router ospf 1 R1(config-router)#network 172.16.0.13 0.0.0.0 area 0 R1(config-router)#network 172.16.128.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 [/code] Looking at the routing table in R1 we can see the 172.30.2.0/24 is reachable by leaving R1’s gigabitEthernet0/1 interface. [code]R1#show ip route Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP a - application route + - replicated route, % - next hop override Gateway of last resort is not set 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 6 subnets, 2 masks C 172.16.0.8/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 L 172.16.0.9/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 L 172.16.0.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.16.128.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 L 172.16.128.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 172.30.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets O 172.30.2.0 [110/2] via 172.16.0.10, 00:03:39, GigabitEthernet0/1 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets C 192.168.0.1 is directly connected, Loopback0 [/code] So depending if you have a newer IOS software there is another way to configure OSPF instead of using the network command while in the (config-router) prompt. This newer method is configured by going under the interface of which you want OSPF to run. Let’s configure it on R3 and R4. We still have to switch on OSPF by running the **router ospf 1** command but then we can go to the interfaces. [code]R4(config)#router ospf 1 R3(config)#router ospf 1 [/code] Now let’s go to gigabitethernet0/1 on R4 and tell OSPF this is the interface we want OSPF running on. Also notice the adjacency with R2 this is good news. [code]R4(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/1 R4(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0 *Aug 13 01:50:10.698: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.0.2 on GigabitEthernet0/1 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done [/code] Let’s continue this on all remaining interfaces on R4 and R3. [code]R4(config)# R4(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/2 R4(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0 R4(config-if)#exit R4(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/3 R4(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0 R4(config-if)#exit *Aug 13 01:55:07.905: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.0.1 on GigabitEthernet0/3 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done R4(config)# --ROUTER 3 -- R3(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/1 R3(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0 R3(config-if)#exit *Aug 13 01:58:39.091: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.0.4 on GigabitEthernet0/1 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done R3(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/2 R3(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0 R3(config-if)#exit *Aug 13 01:59:01.142: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.0.1 on GigabitEthernet0/2 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done R3(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/3 R3(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0 R3(config-if)#exit *Aug 13 01:59:37.701: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.0.2 on GigabitEthernet0/3 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done R3(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/4 R3(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0 R3(config-if)#exit R3(config)# [/code] We now have OSPF setup. We can verify this by typing **show ip ospf neighbor**. [code]R1#show ip ospf neighbor Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface 192.168.0.4 1 FULL/BDR 00:00:35 172.16.128.2 GigabitEthernet0/3 192.168.0.3 1 FULL/BDR 00:00:35 172.16.0.14 GigabitEthernet0/2 192.168.0.2 1 FULL/DR 00:00:31 172.16.0.10 GigabitEthernet0/1 ------ R2#show ip ospf neighbor Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface 192.168.0.3 1 FULL/BDR 00:00:38 172.16.128.6 GigabitEthernet0/3 192.168.0.4 1 FULL/DR 00:00:35 172.16.128.10 GigabitEthernet0/2 192.168.0.1 1 FULL/BDR 00:00:34 172.16.0.9 GigabitEthernet0/1 ------- R3#show ip ospf neighbor Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface 192.168.0.2 1 FULL/DR 00:00:32 172.16.128.5 GigabitEthernet0/3 192.168.0.1 1 FULL/DR 00:00:38 172.16.0.13 GigabitEthernet0/2 192.168.0.4 1 FULL/DR 00:00:32 172.16.128.14 GigabitEthernet0/1 -------- R4#show ip ospf neighbor Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface 192.168.0.1 1 FULL/DR 00:00:31 172.16.128.1 GigabitEthernet0/3 192.168.0.3 1 FULL/BDR 00:00:33 172.16.128.13 GigabitEthernet0/2 192.168.0.2 1 FULL/BDR 00:00:36 172.16.128.9 GigabitEthernet0/1 [/code] Let’s look at the routing table of R3, do we have route to 172.30.2.0/24 network? It looks like we do but why do we see only one route? [code]R3#show ip route Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP a - application route + - replicated route, % - next hop override Gateway of last resort is not set 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 2 masks O 172.16.0.8/30 [110/2] via 172.16.128.5, 00:02:06, GigabitEthernet0/3 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 00:02:45, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 L 172.16.0.14/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 O 172.16.128.0/30 [110/2] via 172.16.128.14, 00:03:05, GigabitEthernet0/1 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 00:02:45, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.16.128.4/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 L 172.16.128.6/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 O 172.16.128.8/30 [110/2] via 172.16.128.14, 00:03:05, GigabitEthernet0/1 [110/2] via 172.16.128.5, 00:02:06, GigabitEthernet0/3 C 172.16.128.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 L 172.16.128.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 172.30.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 3 subnets, 2 masks O 172.30.2.0/24 [110/2] via 172.16.128.5, 00:02:06, GigabitEthernet0/3 C 172.30.3.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 L 172.30.3.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets O 192.168.0.1 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 00:02:45, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 192.168.0.3 is directly connected, Loopback0 [/code] Remember that OSPF will choose the best path and put that path in the routing table. Going straight to R2 instead of going through R1 or R4. However OSPF knows about the other two routes which is why it is able to converge quickly. That&#39;s an important tip when comparing distance vector protocols vs link state protocols. In link state protocols routers know about the entire topology within an area and each router determines the shortest path to available destinations. So in case of a failure of the link the router would already know what path to take so there is no need to re-converge the routing table. Take a look at the routing table of R3 again after I disabled interface Gig0/3 on R2. [code]R3#show ip route Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP a - application route + - replicated route, % - next hop override Gateway of last resort is not set 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 2 masks O 172.16.0.8/30 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 01:04:20, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 L 172.16.0.14/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 O 172.16.128.0/30 [110/2] via 172.16.128.14, 01:04:40, GigabitEthernet0/1 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 01:04:20, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.16.128.4/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 L 172.16.128.6/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 O 172.16.128.8/30 [110/2] via 172.16.128.14, 01:04:40, GigabitEthernet0/1 C 172.16.128.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 L 172.16.128.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 172.30.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 3 subnets, 2 masks O 172.30.2.0/24 [110/3] via 172.16.128.14, 00:31:22, GigabitEthernet0/1 [110/3] via 172.16.0.13, 00:31:22, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 172.30.3.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 L 172.30.3.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets O 192.168.0.1 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 01:04:20, GigabitEthernet0/2 C 192.168.0.3 is directly connected, Loopback0 R3# [/code] We can now see two routes to the 172.30.2.0 network. Since these paths are equal OSPF will balance between R1 and R4 to get the 172.30.2.0 network. This stays this way until the link between R2 and R3 comes back online. I&#39;ll end it here because that’s all I got for this post like always I hope this information is helpful in understanding the basics of OSPF with in a single area configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;For today let&#39;s discuss a routing protocol that was being thought of in 1987 by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force&#34; title=&#34;Internet Engineering Task Force&#34;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&lt;/a&gt;. OSPF currently has three versions and the first version was in the 1980s when the internet was still being used for research. What is interesting about the first version of OSPF is although one version ran on routers the other type of version ran on UNIX computers. When OSPFv2 come out in the 1990s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization&#34; title=&#34;International Organization for Standardization&#34;&gt;International Organization for Standardization (ISO)&lt;/a&gt; was working on another routing protocol called IS-IS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS&#34; title=&#34;IS-IS&#34;&gt;Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System&lt;/a&gt;). OSPF is considered to be an interior gateway protocol which is like IS-IS but unlike OSPF IS-IS runs on the data-link layer while OSPF runs at layer three the network layer. OSPF is considered to be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol&#34; title=&#34;Link-state routing protocol&#34;&gt;link-state protocol&lt;/a&gt;, unlike &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Routing Information Protocol&#34;&gt;RIP&lt;/a&gt;, RIPv2 and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Interior Gateway Routing Protocol&#34;&gt;IGRP&lt;/a&gt; , this protocol is what OSPF shines on. Instead of looking at hop-count like RIP, OSPF looks at the cost of the link. Take for example the picture below, two routes are available to the destination. One is one hop away while the other is two hops away. If we are using RIP then the route with the least amount of hops is the preferred route. However if OSPF was running it would look at the cost of the link like the bandwidth of the link.  In this example the link with the lowest hop count is also the slowest of the two links. So OSPF would use the link with the highest hop count but in this example that link is also the fastest out of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/11/02/ospf-what-a-protocol/ospf-hop/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/ospf-hop.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;OSPF Hop vs Bandwidth&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes OSPF also a feature is it supports multiple venders instead of Cisco. OSPF is recognized by RFC 2328 and RFC 2740 (IPv6). Compared to RIP OSPF is fast to converge and is able to scale better to larger networks unlike RIP which can only scale to 16 hops and converges slowly compared to OSPF. OSPF has different packet types or LSPs (Link-State Packets) which help OSPF function like it should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hello packets Like the name suggest these packets are like keep-alives and maintain adjacent with other OSPF routers. The meaning of a hello packet is to discover OSPF neighbors and set up adjacencies. In order for each router to form a neighbor the routers must agree on hello interval, dead timer and network type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBD - Database description which has a short list of the sending router&#39;s link state database which is checked against the local link state database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LSR - &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router&#34; title=&#34;Router&#34;&gt;Routers&lt;/a&gt; receiving OSPF information can ask more information about any entry in the DBD by sending a link-state request (LSR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LSU - (Link-state update) Packets used to reply to LSRs and to announce new information. These packets contain seven different types of link-state advertisements (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_advertisement&#34; title=&#34;Link-state advertisement&#34;&gt;LSA&lt;/a&gt;). This goes into a deeper topic that is aimed at the CCNP level, in short LSA and LSUs can be used interchangeably. A LSU has one or more LSAs and a LSA contains route information for destination routes, just remember at the CCNA level their are different types of LSAs which fall under LSUs. Confused? I&#39;ll stop :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LSAck- When an LSU is recived, the router sends a link-state acknowledgment to confirm the router received the LSU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSPF does elect a DR (Designated Router) and a BDR (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First&#34; title=&#34;Open Shortest Path First&#34;&gt;Backup Designated Router&lt;/a&gt;) The DR&#39;s job is to update all other OSPF routers which a called DROthers. when a change happens when using the multiaccess network the BDR monitors the DR and takes over as the DR if the current DR fails. That&#39;s my introduction in to OSPF and it is a somewhat complex protocol that needs a complete understanding before going deeper into the beast! Like always I hope this information helps if you have an idea of the next topic I should cover either with ICND1 or ICND2 comment below. Questions about OSPF? let me hear it!&lt;/p&gt;
