In this lab I am going to post the running-config of both locations so you can either run it through &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_Tracer&#34; title=&#34;Packet Tracer&#34;&gt;Packet Tracer&lt;/a&gt; or live equipment if you wish. I am running two Cisco 2811s with Advanced Security Version 12.4(24)T8. Let&#39;s do it! Take a look at my setup, I am running in the RFC 1918 range on a closed track and &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; have a third &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_%28computing%29&#34; title=&#34;Router (computing)&#34;&gt;router&lt;/a&gt; in the middle just to route between the two &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication&#34; title=&#34;Serial communication&#34;&gt;serial interfaces&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;quot;simulate&amp;quot; the internet. Branch-1 does not know about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network&#34; title=&#34;Local area network&#34;&gt;LAN&lt;/a&gt; on Branch-2, and Branch-2 does not know about the LAN on Branch-1. Our task is to configure a Site-To-Site VPN between the two remote Branch offices to be able reach the remote LANs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/site-to-site-top.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/site-to-site-top.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;Branch-1-and-Branch-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Before we jump right into it here is the running-config of both Branch routers before a VPN is setup so you can walk through this yourself.

Check out my &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2013/03/10/introduction-into-cisco-configuration-professional/&#34; title=&#34;Introduction into Cisco Configuration Professional&#34;&gt;Introduction into CCP&lt;/a&gt; which talks about what CCP is and goes through the some of the basics on how to discover devices. So for this example I already have CCP opened on a PC that is on Branch-1&#39;s LAN and have already discovered Branch-1. In CCP I want to create a site-to-site VPN so in order for that to happen I&#39;ll click Configure at the top of the program and expand the Security folder and select Site-To-Site VPN. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-1e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-1e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-1E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once we selected the site-to-site VPN option we are presented with a general overview of what a site-to-site VPN is and  its functions. Our task is to create a site-to-site VPN so let us select the tab &amp;quot;Create a Site-To-Site-VPN&amp;quot; and then follow that by selecting &amp;quot;Launch the selected task&amp;quot; button. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-2e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-2e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-2E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A window popup should appear something like picture below, basically giving you two options. The quick setup would probably work as it would generate a lot of default commands and if you have two Cisco routers at each end it along with running the quick setup on both ends, you would probably get a VPN up and running with very little configuration effort on your part. But for this guide I want to walk through the advanced setup and look at all the gears and knobs of a VPN. Let&#39;s continue select next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-3e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-3e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-3E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The next couple of options go over the IKE proposals (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange&#34; title=&#34;Internet Key Exchange&#34;&gt;Internet Key Exchange&lt;/a&gt;) which is all about handling the way keys are passed between devices. So we are not even talking about data being passed yet, just ISAKMP. Since we are on Branch-1 we want to select our outside interface which happens to be the (1) serial interface 0/0/1. The next option is selecting who our peer is or where would we like to build a VPN tunnel which in this case its Branch-2 who&#39;s outside address is  (2) 192.168.20.2. The final section is to create a (3) pre-shared Key that must match on both sides. It is best to create long pre-shared key in a production environment but since this is on a closed course I kept it short and simple, select next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-4e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-4e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-4E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Like mentioned their actually two tunnels being built for this VPN one of them is just the routers to talk amongst themselves to make sure they agree on the keys and secrets and a second one for data traffic to pass through. This IKE default proposal would work if Branch-2 had the same proposal on Branch-2 but let&#39;s create our own. Select Add. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-5e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-5e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-5E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Another window shows and we are now configuring the IKE Policy, I decided to use (1) AES 256 bit encryption with (2) SHA 1 which is 160 bit hash we are using (3) shared secrets with a (4) Diffie Hellman group 2 and finally with a lifetime of 24 hours which is default. Select OK &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-6e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-6e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-6E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now we can see our other IKE proposal that we created. Select Next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-7e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-7e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-7E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The next section is for our IPsec Tunnel which is the tunnel that our data goes through select add to create a transform set, I am going to call this set (1) &amp;quot;BRANCH-TRANS-SET&amp;quot; we are going to (2) check the integrity of data also called ESP. For the (3) Integrity Algorithm will be ESP SHA HMAC and the (4) encryption will be ESP AES 256. Select OK. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-8e-ike.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-8e-ike.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-8E-IKE&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our Transform Set is created and we could create more if we wanted to. Let&#39;s select next &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-9e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-9e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-9E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This next section is what traffic would we like to protect with our recently IPec tunnel so we type our local LAN because we want to be able access the remote network (Branch-2&#39;s LAN) over our protected tunnel. Select Next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-10e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-10e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-10E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We have reached the summary screen which gives us an overview of what will about happen if we decide to deliver these commands by clicking Finish. Let&#39;s see what happens. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-11e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-11e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-11E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Since this is treated like an internet connection I have setup a NAT/PAT rule to translate address to my serial interface on Branch-1. Basically CCP detected this rule and wants to change it. So for this example I will let CCP go ahead and make the change by selecting Yes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-12e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-12e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-12E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here is a list commands CCP has generated to make my VPN tunnel a dream come true and is about deliver them. Let&#39;s deliver these commands! &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-13e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ccp-13e.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-13E&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Unfortunately the tunnel is still down because we have to configure the other side which is Branch-2. We want to do the same thing we did on Branch-1 but change our peer to point to 192.168.20.10 (which is Branch-1&#39;s outside address)  Add the same IKE Proposal and Transform-Set as did with Branch-1 onto Branch-2 and finally flip our traffic to protect. For the local network we put Branch-2&#39;s LAN and for the remote we put Branch-1&#39;s LAN. Once both sides are created they won&#39;t come up until that interesting traffic comes along either from Branch-1&#39;s LAN going to Branch-2&#39;s LAN or Branch-2&#39;s LAN going to Branch-1&#39;s LAN. So I have a PC on Branch-2 and to test this tunnel  I am able to ping Branch-1&#39;s FastEthernet Interface (192.168.40.1) from 192.168.50.6 which is my PC. [code]C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&amp;gt;ipconfig Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : BRANCH2.CISCOSKILLS.NET IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.50.6 Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.50.1 C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&amp;gt;ping 192.168.40.1 Pinging 192.168.40.1 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 192.168.40.1: bytes=32 time=7ms TTL=254 Reply from 192.168.40.1: bytes=32 time=9ms TTL=254 Reply from 192.168.40.1: bytes=32 time=5ms TTL=254 Reply from 192.168.40.1: bytes=32 time=5ms TTL=254 Ping statistics for 192.168.40.1: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: Minimum = 5ms, Maximum = 9ms, Average = 6ms C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&amp;gt;[/code] As we can see I am to ping this connection and that also confirms that the VPN tunnel is up! I hope this tutorial is helpful and below you will find the running-config of both Branch-1 and Branch-2 &#39;s configuration of making this VPN work. &lt;strong&gt;Remember for a closed track you &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; need another router in the middle of the branches but don&#39;t advertise the LANs.&lt;/strong&gt; Go ahead and load it in Packet Tracer and or live equipment and give it shot you might have to reconfigure some settings deepening on your setup and Packet Tracer does not accept all of the commands. Good Luck and comment below if you have questions! I would be happy to answer them :) [code]#################################################################### ## START OF RUNNING-CONFIG FOR BRANCH-1 AND BRANCH-2 ## #################################################################### ## START OF CONFIGURATION OF BRANCH-1 ## !

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s walk through the basics with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; Configuration Professional as it is a helpful tool to use at the associate levels of the Cisco certification track and needed if you are looking at getting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;CCNA Security&lt;/a&gt; certification. In this introduction we will introduce CCP and setup a community and then finally discover our devices within CCP. This is not the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&#34; title=&#34;Graphical user interface&#34;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; tool Cisco has produced to manage individual routers, an older tool called Cisco SDM also helped Network Administrators which supports the ISR Generation 1 routers. In this blog a while back I talked about Cisco SDM and walked through &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/tag/cisco-sdm/&#34; title=&#34;Tag Cisco SDM&#34;&gt;some tutorials on using it&lt;/a&gt;. Although it&#39;s reaching age with Cisco support it is still officially supported until February 28th 2014. The good news with CCP is it supports these older ISR Generation 1 routers as well as the new ISR Generation 2 routers, were Cisco SDM only support ISR G1 routers. In this tutorial I am using CCP version 2.6 and to get your hands on CCP all you need is a login into Cisco (which is free), your account does not need to have any current support contracts tied to it, just be sure to download the 160MB file and install it on a PC that has access to the supported Cisco routers. The system requirements to run CCP is to have Java installed and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player&#34; title=&#34;Adobe Flash Player&#34;&gt;Adobe Flash player&lt;/a&gt; along with at least 1GB of RAM (it won&#39;t let you install it if you have less). NOTE: I have had the hardest time getting this working on Windows 7 with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&#34; title=&#34;Internet Explorer&#34;&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; 9 so I bailed and went to running &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&#34; title=&#34;Windows XP&#34;&gt;Windows XP SP3&lt;/a&gt; with Internet Explorer 8. Let me know if you can get it working with Windows 7, according to Cisco it&#39;s supported, here the Release Notes for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_configuration_professional/v2_6/rlsnts/ccp_rel_notes.html&#34; title=&#34;Release Notes for Cisco Configuration Professional 2.6&#34;&gt;Cisco Configuration Professional 2.6&lt;/a&gt; to prove it. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Thanks to Kevin and his suggestion I was able to get CCP working with Windows 7 and Windows Vista using Internet Explorer 9. In either Windows 7 and Windows Vista, Right-Click on the CCP icon and select Run as Administrator&lt;/strong&gt; (An easy fix) :) After CCP is installed you&#39;ll need a router, or if you just want to see what it looks like you can demo this program. When you demo this program not all features will be enabled, but it does get you familiar with the CCP interface. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-demo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-demo.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-Demo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When you first open CCP you will be presented a screen to manage your community. A community is a group of routers that may or may not share something in common. This could be that all routers in community called group A are physically at building A, or you could use the hierarchical model and have a community for all core routers but then a separate community for all branch routers. Or you could have all of your routers in one community in the end the design of how to organize it is up to you. A CCP Community can have up to ten routers in one community, so if you have more ten routers you will have to use at least two different communities. In this example you can see I have three routers all in one community called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation&#34; title=&#34;Acme Corporation&#34;&gt;Acme Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. If you noticed on the Manage Community page there is an option to connect securely, this is recommend if this is in a production environment as it protects the username and password with SSH and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure&#34; title=&#34;HTTP Secure&#34;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;. In this example I selected the check box Discover all devices which is towards the bottom of the Manage Community page, CCP would attempt to login into each router with the username and password I provided and read its current running-configuration. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-community.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-community.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-Community&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You could also discover each device manually if you did not want to discover all routers in the community by just selecting the router&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; and choosing the option Discover. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-discover.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-discover.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-Discover&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I would say that&#39;s a good introduction into CCP. I would go ahead and download the program and get comfortable with it. Because it is an area the CCNA Security exam is likely to test on. CCP has a lot of features to it and we only started at the basics for getting the program running and discovering our devices. Check back often as I would like to go through some of the wizards within CCP as well as some of the advanced functionally that is available with CCP, you don&#39;t always have to go command-line commando and I would consider CCP a good program to use for your technical toolbox. Like always I hope this information is helpful. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan, this from the cisco security lab manual: Note: If the PC is running Windows 7, it may be necessary to right-click on the Cisco CP icon or menu item, and choose Run as administrator. In order to run CCP, it may be necessary to temporarily disable antivirus programs and O/S firewalls. Make sure that all pop-up blockers are turned off in the browser. Also you need to upgrade or downgrade your java version if you are using IE...I can find out the version if you need to know or you can check the cisco forum. &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:alan777gfa@gmail.com&#34;&gt;alan777gfa@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; Good article.

&lt;p&gt;It does work on win7, but my problem is that, contrary to what you said, its not very good at working with gen1 isr&#39;s. Usually i get only partial functionality with older routers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Kevin, Good to know, I figured it was possible to work Windows 7. I just have not had any luck with it. I am curious what functionally is missing on the ISR G1s that you have seen? Most of the G1s have to have at least a 12.4(9)T IOS image on them. (At least according to Cisco) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9422/data&#34;&gt;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9422/data&lt;/a&gt;_sheet_c78_462210.html Ryan&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/thinking.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/thinking.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The thing that makes networks awesome is the fact that once you setup a network you&#39;re not done. That may sound like a drawback but it is excellent job security! Engineers or administrators must watch the performance of an organization&#39;s network to make sure that productivity is not affected. Network outages can have a huge effect on an organization, lost revenue and the cost of unproductive employees can severely damage the organization, Earlier this year I also talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/15/troubleshooting-process/&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting Process&#34;&gt;troubleshooting process&lt;/a&gt; which goes hand in hand with network troubleshooting. One of the major things a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator&#34; title=&#34;Network administrator&#34;&gt;network engineer&lt;/a&gt; or administrator needs to have is documentation of the network. That may sound like common sense and it is but with outdated documentation or no documentation at all makes it difficult to diagnose where the problem is and even more difficult if more help is needed from outside sources. Just with your computer, car and home, networks need to have a regular maintenance from time to time. Spending time on an operational network can improve its performance and uptime. Instead using the &amp;quot;duct tape&amp;quot; approach when outages occur. So we know documentation is important but it always seems to be on the backburner, &amp;quot;I&#39;ll get to it when there is time to burn&amp;quot; From my recent experience working with a hospital is that when things went down I had no idea where to start, the documentation was outdated twice over and let&#39;s just say the problem could have been fixed in 5 minutes instead of an hour. Needless to say I broke out &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visio&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft Visio&#34;&gt;Microsoft Visio&lt;/a&gt; and worked from the ground up. Having documentation is good idea but the kicker is to remember to update it when changes occur :). &lt;strong&gt;Simple problems are usually simple solutions&lt;/strong&gt;, we all have been there, a problem comes up 5 minutes before heading home and the problem itself is simple but for whatever reason the solution cannot be found. From my experience from troubleshooting labs and real world environments I have found that looking at the whole problem helps and take it one step at a time. For example a server or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; no longer has &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_network&#34; title=&#34;Access network&#34;&gt;network access&lt;/a&gt;, does another PC or server that&#39;s on the same network able to use the resources needed? Continue to use the Troubleshooting Process and ask those simple questions until the solution is found. &lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t cover your tracks!&lt;/strong&gt; I have done this couple of times myself, when configuring a device like a router, switch, firewall etc. no matter how simple the configuration change seems to be always, copy the commands to a text file after you configured the device. Or better yet copy the commands to a text document first, read it through to make sure it seems correct and if something fails reverse the command. &lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t copy-run start!&lt;/strong&gt; This kind of goes with the one above but this method has saved me in some sketchy areas. When I take an already working device and throw some extra commands on it and now it disconnects from the network making an already problem worse than before. A simple reload or a pull of a power plug brings the device up before I made those changes. Once I have confirmed that those commands worked I then issue the famous copy run start command. &lt;strong&gt;Monitor your network,&lt;/strong&gt; How do you know what &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; looks like when you have nothing looking at it? There are tons of paid and free tools to help you find that &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; network load. So when something happens outside of normal you know about it. Some tools that I have worked with are &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paessler_Router_Traffic_Grapher&#34; title=&#34;Paessler Router Traffic Grapher&#34;&gt;PRTG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Router_Traffic_Grapher&#34; title=&#34;Multi Router Traffic Grapher&#34;&gt;MRTG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog&#34; title=&#34;Syslog&#34;&gt;Syslog&lt;/a&gt; servers like Kiwi Syslog, I have also heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagios&#34; title=&#34;Nagios&#34;&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whatsupgold.com/&#34; title=&#34;WhatsUp Gold&#34;&gt;WhatsUp Gold&lt;/a&gt;, and much more. A simple search will point you in the right direction ;). I hope this information is helpful when troubleshooting networks because although it can be a headache sometimes it&#39;s my favorite part of the job. If you have any ideas for the next topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 you can always comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Link-State Protocols</title>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/network-cables.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/network-cables.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Network-Cables&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Weeks ago and maybe months :), I talked about distance vector protocols and with that you probably got the feeling that when using a distance vector protocol it does not give a full network graphical representation of the entire network. Only the directly connected routes can&#39;t remember? Check out this post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/06/15/distance-vector-routing/&#34; title=&#34;Distance Vector Routing&#34;&gt;Distance Vector Routing&lt;/a&gt;. Link state protocols are faster to converge network changes compared to distance vector however when compared to distance vector setup they can be harder to set up, maintain, and troubleshoot when problems arise. Although the core design of a link-state protocol is like distance vector, meaning it will send updates to neighboring &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router&#34; title=&#34;Router&#34;&gt;routers&lt;/a&gt;, it does this in an entirely different way. Routers that use link-state advertise every possible route in the network. This process is called flooding which means every router in the network has the same information. This information is stored in RAM and called the link-state database (LSDB). The link-state protocol uses this information for other process, like to calculate the &amp;quot;best routes&amp;quot; to each subnet. You can probably guess that when using a link-state protocol it will use more resources like CPU and memory compared to distance vector, Your&#39; right. The link-state protocols relay on LSAs (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol&#34; title=&#34;Link-state routing protocol&#34;&gt;Link-state&lt;/a&gt; advertisements) which are broken down in two main types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Router &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_advertisement&#34; title=&#34;Link-state advertisement&#34;&gt;LSA&lt;/a&gt; - Includes the a number to identify the router called the router ID. The router&#39;s interface &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt;, subnet masks, the state of link (Up or Down), and the cost of the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link LSA- Which identifies each link the subnet and the routers that are attached to that link. It also identifies if the link is either up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These LSAs are created by the router and then floods the LSA to other routers their neighbors. The thing that makes link-state protocol a topic starter is that they look at the &amp;quot;Link&amp;quot; of the connection and advertise each interface even if the connection is up or down. The LSDB has information about not only the up and working routers, interfaces, and networks, but all routers and interfaces even if the interfaces are down. With link-state protocols it creates a complete network topology in each router unlike distance vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol&#34;&gt;IP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol&#34; title=&#34;Routing protocol&#34;&gt;Routing Protocols&lt;/a&gt; use Link-State? Take a guess!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Vector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*EIGRP is considered a hybrid routing protocol (Uses the best of both Distance Vector and Link-State protocols) In some Cisco documentation EIGRP is also referred to as an advance distance vector protocol. Link-State Protocols converge much quickly than distance vector, they do consume more RAM and CPU when compared to distance vector. They avoid routing loops by default unlike with distance vector which requires more features like split horizon. Distance vector is easier to set up when compared to link-state which requires more thought when configuring it correctly. I have opened another door towards the ICND2 path, so let&#39;s stop for now and let it sink-in. Like always you have power of the internet at your hands if you can&#39;t wait a simple search will do. As I always say I hope this information is helpful and if you have an idea of the next topic that I should talk about that deals with ether ICND1 or ICND2 let&#39;s hear it!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ipv6.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ipv6.png&#34; alt=&#34;Are we ready for IPv6?&#34; title=&#34;IPv6&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So what is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6&#34; title=&#34;IPv6&#34;&gt;IPv6&lt;/a&gt; day? Today major companies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google&#34; title=&#34;Google&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook&#34; title=&#34;Facebook&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21&#34; title=&#34;Yahoo!&#34;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider&#34; title=&#34;Internet service provider&#34;&gt;ISPs&lt;/a&gt; (Internet Service Providers) test their IPv6 deployments. Why is this important? Well if you follow IPv4 news you might already know that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4&#34; title=&#34;IPv4&#34;&gt;IPv4 addresses&lt;/a&gt; have been exhausted and the need to move to different &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space&#34; title=&#34;Address space&#34;&gt;address space&lt;/a&gt; is critical, if new web services are to be deployed. The question is can we run both? Although running two different &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP addressing&lt;/a&gt; protocols is likely, by &amp;quot;stacking&amp;quot; them that is one reason the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society&#34; title=&#34;Internet Society&#34;&gt;Internet Society&lt;/a&gt; wanted major sites and ISPs to test out the IPv6 address space. One of the main goals the Internet Society wants companies to look at is if there are potential issues, these issues are in controlled environments and can be addressed as soon as possible. So what should the average user see on Wednesday June 8th? Well if everything goes to plan the user should not noticed any difference. That&#39;s the amazing thing these configurations, testing and deployments are in the backend of the internet. A good tool to test to your internet connection to see if it can handle IPv6 traffic is the IPv6 Eye Chart which is the link below. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipv6eyechart.ripe.net/&#34; title=&#34;IPv6 Eye Chart&#34;&gt;IPv6 Eye Chart&lt;/a&gt; I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea for a topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me know about it, also check out my earlier topics that I have posted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;This is the master list of some of the many &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS&#34; title=&#34;Cisco IOS&#34;&gt;Cisco IOS&lt;/a&gt; Commands that go with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNA&#34; title=&#34;CCNA&#34;&gt;CCNA&lt;/a&gt; track. This list also talks about what each command does in &lt;strong&gt;brief&lt;/strong&gt; detail. You may also find that some commands may or may not be used for a CCNA level but offer some important information. If you don&#39;t know what a command does or understand it, I would look at Cisco documentation. Since this is a pretty big list of commands you can see the links to move to the different sections within this page. Enjoy! &lt;a href=&#34;#PrivilegedMode&#34;&gt;Privileged Mode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#Setconp&#34;&gt;Set a password for console access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#Setvtyp&#34;&gt;Set a Password for virtual terminal (telnet) access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#Setauxp&#34;&gt;Set a password for auxiliary (modem) access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#Setuprouter&#34;&gt;Setting up the Router&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#Generalcom&#34;&gt;General Commands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#Processesstats&#34;&gt;Processes and Statistics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#cdpcom&#34;&gt;CDP Commands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous Commands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Privileged Mode:&lt;/strong&gt; [code]Router&amp;gt;enable[/code] This command &amp;quot;enable&amp;quot;will get you in privileged mode in the router or switch.

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/wirelesssecurity.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/wirelesssecurity.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Wireless-Security-Icon&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although having a wireless LAN sounds like a wonderful idea, there are things that need to be implemented like security. A wireless LAN can be uncontrollable has it is just radio waves and anybody can receive them. Having and using good security practices can help you be under control of your wireless LAN.  Not having any security in a wireless LAN environment will cause anybody to have access to the network. Some threats that lead to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Wireless LAN&#34;&gt;wireless LANs&lt;/a&gt; can be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War Drivers – These are people who &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; around to find open networks that are not secure and looking for free internet access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackers – These types of people usually have malicious ideas in mind; this can be anything to entering unauthorized systems and stealing data or even harming the physical system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees –Although we may have an excellent defense on the outside of our network, we sometimes forget that the inside of our network needs to be secure as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original 802.11 standard there were two types of authentication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open authentication, which as the name implies has no authentication and will allow anybody to use the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared authentication, which used &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy&#34; title=&#34;Wired Equivalent Privacy&#34;&gt;WEP&lt;/a&gt; and is now flawed, The WEP algorithm was weak and WEP was also not very scalable. (See post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/14/cracking-wep/&#34; title=&#34;Cracking WEP&#34;&gt;Cracking WEP&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are two enterprise-level encryption methods which are specified in the 802.11i and are certified as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access&#34; title=&#34;Wi-Fi Protected Access&#34;&gt;WPA&lt;/a&gt; and WPA2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Key_Integrity_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Temporal Key Integrity Protocol&#34;&gt;TKIP&lt;/a&gt; is an encryption method certified has WPA, TKIP supports for legacy WLAN equipment by fixing the flaws with the original 802.11 WEP encryption. TKIP encrypts at the layer 2 (Data Link) payloads and carries a message of integrity check (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code&#34; title=&#34;Message authentication code&#34;&gt;Message Integrity Check&lt;/a&gt;) in the encrypted packet. This helps to make sure the message or packet was not tampered with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AES is an encryption method certified has WPA2, AES has the same functions as TKIP but does use additional data from the MAC header to recognize if the data has been tampered with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some steps to check when setting up a wireless LAN is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the wired network, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol&#34;&gt;DHCP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access&#34; title=&#34;Internet access&#34;&gt;Internet access&lt;/a&gt; before setting up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point&#34; title=&#34;Wireless access point&#34;&gt;wireless access point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next install the access point but by keeping it away from devices that could case greater interference .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29&#34; title=&#34;Service set (802.11 network)&#34;&gt;SSID&lt;/a&gt; on the access point. Don&#39;t put security on the access point yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure or install one or two wireless clients. Don&#39;t put security on these devices yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify wireless network operation within the clients. Check to make sure you can get access to network resources and outside the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_security&#34; title=&#34;Wireless security&#34;&gt;wireless security&lt;/a&gt;. Such as WPA2 with PSK .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify network operation again to make sure that the wireless clients can get access to network resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now that&#39;s my summary for the basic wireless security, this really goes over the concepts but not the configuration. There are a lot of online guides that can go into the configuration aspect of the wireless client and the access point. Like always I hope this information was informative and if you come up with any other ideas that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me know by posting a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding VTP</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/11/understanding-vtp/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Some people hate it, some people love it. It&#39;s the Cisco proprietary &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN_Trunking_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;VLAN Trunking Protocol&#34;&gt;VLAN Trunking Protocol&lt;/a&gt; (VTP) which in short means that Cisco switches can exchange VLAN configuration, instead of manually configuring each switch with the same &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Virtual LAN&#34;&gt;VLANs&lt;/a&gt;. I also suggest if you don&#39;t know what a VLAN is check out the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/01/creating-vlans/&#34; title=&#34;Creating VLANs&#34;&gt;Creating VLANs&lt;/a&gt; Let&#39;s get right into understanding VTP. The thing that makes VTP shine is what it does, although simple to understand it saves time by automatically distributing VLAN information. Take for example if you had 20 switches that need the same VLANs you could do it manually but this runs the risk of human error, with VTP if you configure one switch as a server and all other switches as clients then you can configure all of them. VTP uses Layer two messages to exchange information if a server switch changes or removes VLANS VTP will synchronize all switches so all switches have the same VLANs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/11/understanding-vtp/vlan_trunking_protocol_/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vlan_trunking_protocol_.gif?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;VLAN Trunking Protocol&#34; title=&#34;VLAN_Trunking_Protocol&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The VTP server distributes VLAN configuration changes through VTP messages, sent over &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Inter-Switch_Link&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Inter-Switch Link&#34;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.1Q&#34;&gt;802.1Q&lt;/a&gt; trunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISL is an older technology along with being Cisco proprietary. ISL also fully encapsulates the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet&#34;&gt;original Ethernet&lt;/a&gt; frame inside the ISL header remain unchanged. Along with using the source and destination &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC addresses&lt;/a&gt; in the ISL header to send and receiving to a switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.1Q is an open-standard created by IEEE and uses a different header than ISL to tag frames, with the VLAN number. 802.1Q does not encapsulate the original frame into another &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet frame&#34;&gt;Ethernet header&lt;/a&gt; and trailer. 802.1Q inserts and extra 4-byte VLAN header into the original frame&#39;s Ethernet header. The frame still has the original source and destination MAC address unlike ISL. Also because the original header has been expanded 802.1Q forces a FCS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_check_sequence&#34; title=&#34;Frame check sequence&#34;&gt;Frame check sequence&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default when a switch is powered on the VTP mode is server, VTP servers and clients can choose whether to react to the received VTP update, by either update their VLAN configuration or ignore it. This is based on the VLAN database configuration revision number. Each time the VTP server modifies its VLAN configuration the VTP server increments the current configuration revision number by 1. If the revision number increases and is higher than a client switch or server switch, it will update its VLAN database. This is where VTP can destroy your network if set up incorrectly or not securely. If you have a &amp;quot;rouge&amp;quot; VTP server that has a higher revision number then the other VTP server, all switches in the domain including the VTP server will change and update the VLAN configuration based on the &amp;quot;rouge&amp;quot; VTP server. There are three VTP Modes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server Mode, Servers can create VLANs and distribute VLAN configuration changes through VTP messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client Mode, Clients cannot be used to configure VLAN information they only learn about VLANs by VTP servers and only forward VTP messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent Mode, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28computing%29&#34; title=&#34;Transparency (computing)&#34;&gt;Transparent mode&lt;/a&gt; switches never update their VLAN database on incoming VTP messages. Like servers they can however create VLANs, they also will send VTP messages to help out other switches in server or client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VTP defines three message types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary advertisements - list the revision number, domain name, and other information but no VLAN information. These are summary advertisements that occur every 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subset advertisements - occur when a new a larger revision number is introduced which is some subset of the VLAN database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request message - Allows the switch to immediately request VTP messages from a neighboring switch as soon as a trunk comes up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VTP does have some other features like VTP Pruning, passwords protection and domains but that all in the configuration side. An interesting side note is that VTP cannot be turned off. There is no disable command in the switch IOS, if you want to turn off VTP on a switch change the mode to transparent. You can find additional information about VTP at Cisco.com along with a web search. Like always I hope this information was informative and if you have a topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know by commenting below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic Routing Protocols</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/04/dynamic-routing-protocols/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2011 16:40:24 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/04/dynamic-routing-protocols/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/networking.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/networking.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Dynamic Routing&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you ever wanted to set up a network manually, you will quickly find how much overhead is required to get &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt;, printers, and other network equipment. That&#39;s where &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_routing&#34; title=&#34;Adaptive routing&#34;&gt;dynamic routing&lt;/a&gt; protocols come into play although they are helpful I strongly urge you to understand static routing first. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/02/configure-static-routing/&#34; title=&#34;Configure Static Routing&#34;&gt;Configure Static Routing&lt;/a&gt;) So for today&#39;s post let&#39;s get the foundation of understanding dynamic routing protocols. By definition a routing protocol is a set of messages, rules and algorithms used by routers for the overall purpose of learning routes to other networks not physically connected to it. (RIP, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol&#34;&gt;EIGRP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First&#34; title=&#34;Open Shortest Path First&#34;&gt;OSPF&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Border Gateway Protocol&#34;&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; are all examples of routing protocols! When using a dynamic routing protocol routers learn &amp;quot;dynamically&amp;quot; about other remote networks and automatically add these networks to its routing table. However keep in mind that when compared to static routing, dynamic routing require less administrator overhead but they will use the routers resources like, more RAM, more processing time (CPU), and even the network bandwidth&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/04/dynamic-routing-protocols/routing_updates/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/routing_updates.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Routing_Updates&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although there are several routing protocols each of them have their benefits but they all focus on these key things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about networks from other neighboring routers and maintain up-to-date routing information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertise routing information to neighboring routers and thus discovering remote networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If more than route is possible the router will pick the best route based on its metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the any one part of the network fails, react by advertising the bad routes and advertise the best available route. (Convergence)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further about dynamic routing protocols remember there are two type of routing protocols used today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol&#34; title=&#34;Interior gateway protocol&#34;&gt;IGP&lt;/a&gt; (Interior Gateway Protocols) A routing protocol that is designed for a single autonomous system. Some common routing protocols classified under IGP are RIP, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Interior Gateway Routing Protocol&#34;&gt;IGRP&lt;/a&gt;, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocols) A routing protocol that is designed for use in between autonomous systems. A common routing protocol classified under EGP is BGP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/05/04/dynamic-routing-protocols/igp-and-egp/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/igp-and-egp.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;IGP and EGP&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Interior Gateway Protocols are used within a company or organization, once that information leaves the company or organization it moves towards the ISP which would use an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_Gateway_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Exterior Gateway Protocol&#34;&gt;Exterior Gateway Protocol&lt;/a&gt; EGP. So for the picture above think of the clouds to be the inside of a company or organization and outside of that company or organization the routing protocol would change. For now let&#39;s stop there because the dynamic routing protocols open another door, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol&#34; title=&#34;Distance-vector routing protocol&#34;&gt;Distance Vector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol&#34; title=&#34;Link-state routing protocol&#34;&gt;Link-state routing protocols&lt;/a&gt;, and the difference between classful and classless routing protocols along with the different type of administrative distances and metrics, these discussions for another day. :) Like always I hope this information was informative and if you have a topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know by commenting below.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/user.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/user.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;User&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_protocol&#34; title=&#34;AAA protocol&#34;&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; which in the Cisco world means, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication&#34; title=&#34;Authentication&#34;&gt;Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization&#34; title=&#34;Authorization&#34;&gt;Authorization&lt;/a&gt;, and Accounting but what does that really mean? In today&#39;s post that&#39;s what we are going to be talking about. What is AAA and what are the benefits of using it along with what is it? The first &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; of AAA is Authentication which provides the method of identifying users, including login and password dialog, challenge and response, messaging support, and, depending on the security protocol you select, encryption. The second &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; of AAA is Authorization which provides the method for remote &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control&#34; title=&#34;Access control&#34;&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;, including one-time authorization or authorization for each service, per-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_%28computing%29&#34; title=&#34;User (computing)&#34;&gt;user account&lt;/a&gt; list and profile, user group support, and support of IP, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork_Packet_Exchange&#34; title=&#34;Internetwork Packet Exchange&#34;&gt;IPX&lt;/a&gt;, ARA, and Telnet. The third and last &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; of AAA is Accounting which provides the method for collecting and sending security server information used for billing, auditing, and reporting, such as user identities, start and stop times, executed commands (such as PPP), number of packets, and number of bytes. In a real world scenario I like to think of AAA has a police officer or a security guard that is blocking access to a building, they first want to make sure that they know who you are and you give the correct credentials that prove to them you are who you say you are. Once they have verified who you are they will want to check if you are authorized to enter the blocked building once they have approved you to have access they will be able to track or keep a record that you accessed the building. That is the same type of idea that the router or switch will do. Months ago I talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TACACS&#34; title=&#34;TACACS&#34;&gt;TACACS&lt;/a&gt; Plus and RADIUS these are both used to control access to the network. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/10/tacacs-plus-and-radius/&#34; title=&#34;TACACS Plus and RADIUS&#34;&gt;TACACS Plus and RADIUS&lt;/a&gt;) You could say these services are the security guards or police officers. By using AAA it provides the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased flexibility and control of access configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardized authentication methods, such as RADIUS, TACACS+, and Kerberos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple backup systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you apply AAA to a network you now have full control of each network device that supports AAA. The user database is stored on the RADIUS or TACACS+ server, so instead of configuring and putting passwords and usernames for each network device once you configure a username and password on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS&#34; title=&#34;RADIUS&#34;&gt;AAA server&lt;/a&gt; it now can get access to each network resource. You can also give that user certain privileges by specifying if that user can access that device. AAA is like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory&#34; title=&#34;Active Directory&#34;&gt;Active Directory&lt;/a&gt; in the Windows Server environment. You can do a lot of configuration and really lock down your network infrastructure. AAA is not just for routers and switches in IT environments. This type of service can be used VPNs and regular users that use network resources. That&#39;s what I have for AAA if you want to find more information about it go to Cisco.com and like always I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea for any ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know by issuing a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Awhile back I talked about the differences between IPS and IDS. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/09/cisco-ids-vs-ips/&#34; title=&#34;Cisco IDS vs. IPS&#34;&gt;Cisco IDS vs. IPS&lt;/a&gt; ) So for today&#39;s post let&#39;s learn how to configure an IPS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion prevention system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Prevention System&lt;/a&gt;) on a router using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; SDM (Security Device Manger). The Cisco SDM is a Web-based device management tool a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&#34; title=&#34;Graphical user interface&#34;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; for Cisco &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router&#34; title=&#34;Router&#34;&gt;routers&lt;/a&gt; this can simplify router deployments and cut ownership costs. ( See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/14/configure-cisco-sdm/&#34; title=&#34;Configure Cisco SDM&#34;&gt;Configure Cisco SDM&lt;/a&gt;) Let&#39;s start configuring an IPS with SDM! This tutorial is assuming that the configurations to set up Cisco SDM have already been completed. For this tutorial all we want to focus on is configuring the IPS. Since this using Cisco SDM the IPS wizard is pretty easy to understand. Before we get started I like to have the Cisco SDM preview the commands before I deliver them to the router. To do that at the top of the menu bar click &lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt; and select &lt;em&gt;Preferences&lt;/em&gt; a new window will appear (Like below) and verify that the &lt;em&gt;Preview commands before delivering to the router&lt;/em&gt; is checked.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/20/configuring-zone-based-firewalls-via-sdm/preview_commandse/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/preview_commandse.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM Preferences&#34; title=&#34;Preview_Commands&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Before we even jump into the IPS wizard we must verify that we have the IOS IPS signature package file and the public crypto key. If you don&#39;t have them you then must have a CCO account with Cisco to download them. Make sure that these files are available on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Trivial File Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;TFTP&lt;/a&gt; server installed and running. Put or verify that the IOS IPS signature file is in the default TFTP folder (IOS-Sxxx-CLI.pkg) Remember that the X values will vary depending on the file that was download from Cisco. Also verify that the realm-cisco.pub.key.txt file is available on the computer and note its location. This file is the public key that it used by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS&#34; title=&#34;Cisco IOS&#34;&gt;Cisco IOS&lt;/a&gt; IPS. Once Cisco SDM is opened click the configure button at the top of SDM screen and select &lt;em&gt;Intrusion Prevention&lt;/em&gt; on the left hand side under &lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. Click or verify that the &lt;em&gt;Create IPS&lt;/em&gt; tab is selected and select the &lt;em&gt;Launch IPS Rule Wizard&lt;/em&gt; button. If prompted for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Device_Event_Exchange&#34; title=&#34;Security Device Event Exchange&#34;&gt;SDEE&lt;/a&gt; click ok. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_maine/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_maine.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Main Screen&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Main&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  A window will show, the IPS Welcome Screen which gives the objectives the wizard will go over in helping us create an IPS system. Click Next.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_welcomee/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_welcomee.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizared Welcome Page&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Welcome&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next screen (IPS Interface) will want us to select which interface(s) will have the IPS rules, select either inbound or outbound. (For this tutorial both &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet&#34; title=&#34;Fast Ethernet&#34;&gt;Fast-Ethernet&lt;/a&gt; 0/0&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Serial 0/0&lt;/em&gt; will have the IPS rules inbound.) Click Next.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_interfacese/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_interfacese.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Interfaces&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Interfaces&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next screen (Signature File and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography&#34; title=&#34;Public-key cryptography&#34;&gt;Public Key&lt;/a&gt;) wants to know the following information, the location of the signature file and the public key.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_sig_pub_key/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_sig_pub_key.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Signature Public Key&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Sig_Pub_Key&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Focusing on the signature file first you want to specify the location where the signature file is. Click on the three dots button.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_sigfilee/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_sigfilee.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Signature File&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_SigFile&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Another window will open (Specify Signature File) if the signature file is already on the routers flash memory select the first radio button, if the signature file is by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator&#34; title=&#34;Uniform Resource Locator&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; select the correct protocol and address, you can also specify the signature file on the PC. (For this tutorial we are using the TFTP server and are specifying the signature file by URL, once the location of the file has been selected click OK. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_sigfile_spe/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_sigfile_spe.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Signature File Location&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_SigFile_SP&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Now let&#39;s focus on the Public Key, in the name of the public key type realm-cisco.pub or relam-cisco.pub signature. Find and open the realm-cisco.pub.key.txt file and copy (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-C&#34; title=&#34;Control-C&#34;&gt;Ctrl-C&lt;/a&gt;) the text that is between the phrase key-string and the word quit. Paste the text (key) in the key field in the Configure Key section. Click Next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_public_keye/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_public_keye.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Public Key&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Public_Key&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next section (Config Location and Category) wants you to specify where you want the IPS configuration files click on the three dots and choose your location. (For this tutorial we are using flash to store the IPS configuration) Towards the bottom of the screen the wizard wants to choose a signature category for the router. (For this tutorial we are choosing the advanced option.) Click Next. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_config_locatione/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_config_locatione.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Config Location&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Config_Location&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next section is the summary window for the IPS configuration, here you can look over the summary to verify the configuration. Click Finish. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_summarye/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_summarye.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Summary&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Summary&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you&#39;ve selected the option to preview commands before delivering them to the router, a final window will appear. In this window you can see the actual commands the SDM program will attempt to deliver. You have the option to save the running-configuration to the startup-configuration after the commands complete. You also have the option to save the configuration as a file and finally you can deliver them to the router. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/22/configure-ips-intrusion-prevention-system-via-sdm/ips_wizard_delivere/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ips_wizard_delivere.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM IPS Wizard Deliver&#34; title=&#34;IPS_Wizard_Deliver&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That&#39;s it! believe it or not that&#39;s the SDM configuration of IOS IPS you can get more information at Cisco&#39;s website about SDM and the configuration settings. Like always I hope this tutorial was informative and if you have a suggestion on the next topic that relates to ICND1 or ICND2 and even some CCNA Security comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Configure Cisco SDM</title>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Today we will be going over the steps that are required to set up the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; SDM (Security Device Manger) The Cisco SDM is a Web-based device management tool a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&#34; title=&#34;Graphical user interface&#34;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; for Cisco routers this can simplify router deployments and cut ownership costs. SDM is fairly easy to set up but you still need at least some experience in the router command-line to get SDM working. This tutorial is already assuming that the Cisco SDM program has been installed on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;. If the router has enough flash you can also install SDM on the router, but it is usually slower and does take some CPU power. My advice is to install it on the PC. To support Cisco SDM the PC must have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III&#34; title=&#34;Pentium III&#34;&gt;Pentium III&lt;/a&gt; or faster processor and at least 512MB of RAM. Cisco SDM also needs Java version 6 or newer installed on the PC. I have found out by personal experience that the newer versions of Java don&#39;t work nice with SDM. The Java version I would stick with when using Cisco SDM is Java version 6 Update 6. I would also suggest that the PC using SDM not be in a production environment because of the older Java version. Another thing that is often a problem when using SDM is the Java heap size or the memory Java uses, Some SDM components need at least 256MB of memory to run correctly, like the IPS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion prevention system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Prevention System&lt;/a&gt; component) To change this find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28software_platform%29&#34; title=&#34;Java (software platform)&#34;&gt;Java application&lt;/a&gt; settings in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Panel_%28Windows%29&#34; title=&#34;Control Panel (Windows)&#34;&gt;Windows Control Panel&lt;/a&gt; double click, Once the Java Control Panel opens click on the tab Java and under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet&#34; title=&#34;Java applet&#34;&gt;Java Applet&lt;/a&gt; Runtime Settings select View. A another window will appear called Java Runtime Settings highlight the Java Runtime Parameters and type the following &lt;em&gt;–Xmx256.&lt;/em&gt; _&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/18/configure-cisco-sdm/java-controle2/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/java-controle2.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Java Control Runtime&#34; title=&#34;Java_Control_Runtime&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;_ With all that out-of-the-way let&#39;s set up SDM. You can do this a couple of ways like add security to the router when connecting to SDM. However this tutorial is going to focus on the required areas that are needed to get SDM working. The first thing that needs to be done is to configure at least one interface on the router that will connect to the computer with SDM installed. For this tutorial it will be Fast-Ethernet 0/0 and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; is 192.168.5.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (Here is the configuration from the router) [code]Router&amp;gt;enable Router#configure terminal Router(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/0 Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.0 Router(config-if)#no shut Router(config-if)#exit[/code] Once the computer and the router are connected to the same network, issue a ping command from the command-line of the PC. The pings should be successful. The last command that is required for SDM to work, is to turn on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server&#34; title=&#34;Web server&#34;&gt;HTTP server&lt;/a&gt; on the router. All other commands like a secure password, AAA, are encouraged but not required for SDM to work. [code]Router(config)#ip http server[/code] Once you have at least the above commands set up launch the SDM program from the computer. The SDM program will want the router&#39;s IP address. (For this tutorial the routers IP address is 192.168.5.1 and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure&#34; title=&#34;HTTP Secure&#34;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/a&gt; is not enabled) If you configured the HTTPS server on the router then select the check box saying &amp;quot;This device has HTTPS enabled and I want to use it&amp;quot;. Otherwise select the Launch button. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/18/configure-cisco-sdm/sdm-launche/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/sdm-launche.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Cisco SDM Launch&#34; title=&#34;SDM Launch&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If no problems occur a couple of things will been showing up on the screen the first thing you will notice is that Internet Explorer will open and screen like below will appear. Although you can close this one, I like to keep these windows open when working with SDM. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/18/configure-cisco-sdm/1st-sdm/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/1st-sdm.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM Loading Page&#34; title=&#34;1st SDM&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next screen is the SDM Launch Page and like it says another window will open along with reminding you not to close this window until you are done with Cisco SDM. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/18/configure-cisco-sdm/sdm-lanuch/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/sdm-lanuch.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM Lanuch Page&#34; title=&#34;SDM Lanuch&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next window will open and you will see a status box. This will be looking at the router platform and running configuration and loading the required information for SDM to work. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/18/configure-cisco-sdm/sdm-stat/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/sdm-stat.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SDM Status&#34; title=&#34;SDM Stat&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After the status box is done, it will close and you now have the Cisco SDM &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; page loaded and are ready to start configuring or monitoring your router with a GUI interface. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/18/configure-cisco-sdm/sdm-main/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/sdm-main.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;The SDM Main Page&#34; title=&#34;SDM Main&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That&#39;s it! You can find more information at Cisco.com and although SDM is being phased out with the new Cisco Configuration Professional program they both have the same goal  to manage a Cisco device with a GUI interface. Like always I hope this tutorial was informative and if you have any ideas on the next topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Troubleshooting Process</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/15/troubleshooting-process/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2011 18:00:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/15/troubleshooting-process/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/thinking.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/thinking.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today&#39;s post is going to be talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubleshooting&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; and where to start the troubleshooting process. Yes there is an actual process that every technician should be aware of. You can also use this troubleshooting process at home, you may not know how to fix it but at least you know where the issue is and find someone who can.  Before we begin if you haven&#39;t seen yet, let me introduce to you the troubleshooting process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to gather information about the problem. (What happened?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it simple, verify the obvious issues FIRST! (Is the device powered on?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try some quick solutions first (restart, reinstall, verify connections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather information from the device (Device Manger, if you are in routers or switches use &amp;quot;Show&amp;quot; commands and &amp;quot;Debug&amp;quot; commands)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your research skills! Evaluate the problem and try possible solutions. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet&#34; title=&#34;Internet&#34;&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; searches, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum&#34; title=&#34;Internet forum&#34;&gt;Online Forums&lt;/a&gt;, past experiences etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally keep note of what you did even if you did not fix the issue. (Keep an engineer notebook!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may look simple, and it is! This is the exact method I use when troubleshooting a problem. Troubleshooting is a hard skill to have, as you really can&#39;t learn from it in a book. You have to have experience with the type of technology you&#39;re working with. One thing I use all the time is my research skills this can be a life saver if you know what to look for, use key details! The internet can be helpful but putting generic terms like &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&#34; title=&#34;Windows XP&#34;&gt;windows XP&lt;/a&gt; is not working&amp;quot; will not help you but instead waste your time. Use the key terms when have an issue like an error code, type the error message, describe what you can&#39;t do, etc. Chances are somebody somewhere has had the same problem or at least something like it and decided to post it. Another thing I like to do when checking on a problem is going to the source! Although there are helpful places around web like forums, and chat systems I usually use this last. If I am having a problem with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft Windows&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; for example I&#39;ll go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Support. Same thing if I have an issue with a Cisco product I&#39;ll go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; Support webpage before I go and search my problem around the web. Finally remember ask other technicians if they have seen the problem. By using these steps and guidelines will be able to become better at troubleshooting like before it&#39;s something you can&#39;t learn from a book you must have experience with technology before you can even start troubleshooting. My last word of advice is keeping a record! Write down the steps you did, why did them and what where the solutions to the problem? If you couldn&#39;t figure it still write it down. That way if the issue occurs again you and other people know exactly how to fix the problem or also know what solutions not work last time and not waste any of your time, like always I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea about the next ICND1 or ICND2 topic comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;On this Monday let&#39;s wrap up the 802.11 wireless standards, Friday I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11g-2003&#34;&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt; (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/08/802-11g/&#34; title=&#34;802.11g&#34;&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt;) and before that I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11b-1999&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/07/802-11b/&#34; title=&#34;802.11b&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; ) I also talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11a-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11a-1999&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;, (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/06/802-11a/&#34; title=&#34;802.11a&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;) I even talked about the 802.11 –Legacy (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/05/802-11-legacy/&#34; title=&#34;802.11 -Legacy&#34;&gt;802.11 –Legacy&lt;/a&gt;) and in the beginning of last week I talked about the basic wireless concepts. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) So let&#39;s end the discussion and talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11n-2009&#34;&gt;802.11n&lt;/a&gt; standard! You could say that the 802.11n standard is the best of both worlds in the 802.11 wireless standards. 802.11n was officially released in October of 2009 and can run in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz&lt;/a&gt; range and use the 5GHz range. Something that is special in the 802.11n standard is the use of multiple-input multiple-output (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO&#34; title=&#34;MIMO&#34;&gt;MIMO&lt;/a&gt;). MIMO is a technology which uses multiple antennas to gather more information essentially. It uses SDM Spatial Division Multiplexing to significantly increase the data throughput. Because of this technology 802.11n can in theory transfer speeds up to 300 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units&#34; title=&#34;Data rate units&#34;&gt;Mbps&lt;/a&gt;. 802.11n is also backwards compatible like the 802.11g standard it can also work with the 802.11b standard. 802.11n can also work with the 802.11a standard in the 5GHz range. Currently 802.11n is the fastest and has the longest range compared to the earlier 802.11 standards. 802.11n indoors has a range of about 230 feet, in outdoor environments the 802.11n has range of about 800 feet. We all know technology changes and a while ago I posted about the 802.11ac standard which does have the potential to travel in speeds up to 1Gbps! (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/21/802-11ac-standard/&#34; title=&#34;802.11ac Standard&#34;&gt;802.11ac Standard&lt;/a&gt;) For now that&#39;s my summary version of the 802.11n standard, like always I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday&#39;s post we talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11a-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11a-1999&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt; standard. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/06/802-11a/&#34; title=&#34;802.11a&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;) We also we talked about the 802.11 – Legacy standard (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/05/802-11-legacy/&#34; title=&#34;802.11 - Legacy&#34;&gt;802.11 – Legacy&lt;/a&gt;) and in the beginning of the week I went over some Basic &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Wireless LAN&#34;&gt;Wireless&lt;/a&gt; Concepts (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) So now that we are up to speed lets learn about the 802.11b standard. The 802.11b standard was developed the same time 802.11a went out, which was in 1999. Some key differences are that 802.11b works in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz&lt;/a&gt; range and only has a maximum bandwidth of 11 (Mbit/s). Along with only using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Direct-sequence spread spectrum&#34;&gt;Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; (DSSS) Like in the 802.11 – Legacy the DSSS had the benefits of Resistance to jamming, you could share the signal channel among other users, it reduced the signal and noise level which helped in interception. Since the 802.11b standard is in the 2.4GHz range there are only three out of the eleven channels that don&#39;t overlap. Also remember that there are other devices that use the 2.4GHz range so 802.11b devices can suffer interference from other products, like cordless phones, microwaves, etc. 802.11b products were on the market pretty quickly in early 2000 because of the cheap material to make them and the wide acceptance of the product/standard. That&#39;s it for today, check back tomorrow and I&#39;ll be posting about the 802.11g standard. Like before I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/h2&gt;

On Monday I talked about the Basic Wireless Concepts (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) in that post I mentioned the wireless standards but did not go further into detail. This post will be going over the second standard 802.11a out of the five standards that make up the 802.11. The 802.11a was published in 1999 and operates in the 5GHz band instead of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz band&lt;/a&gt; because of this 802.11a uses only the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing&#34; title=&#34;Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing&#34;&gt;Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing&lt;/a&gt; (OFDM) which does have an advantage to still operate under severe channel conditions, like attenuation, and interference. The 802.11a in theory has maximum raw data rate of 54Mbit/s however because of the varied conditions you should expect 802.11a to have a maximum speed around 20Mbit/s. What is different between the 802.11a and other 802.11 standards is the fact that the 802.11a standard has 12 channels that are not overlapping each other. Since the 802.11a standard only operates in the 5GHz band it does not get has much interference compared to the 2.4GHz range. That&#39;s it for this summary for the 802.11a standard. Check back tomorrow and I&#39;ll be posting the 802.11b standard. I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Forever ago I talked about TCP (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/25/understanding-tcp/&#34; title=&#34;Understanding TCP&#34;&gt;Understanding TCP&lt;/a&gt;) and I said that in that post that UDP would be another day, well this is the day where we get to understand UDP, which stands for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;User Datagram Protocol&#34;&gt;User Datagram Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. UDP is the total opposite of the TCP communication. UDP in short sends information or data without notifying the receiver that its sending data. UDP is considered a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_protocol&#34; title=&#34;Connectionless protocol&#34;&gt;connectionless protocol&lt;/a&gt;, and does not guarantee the reliability or order the packets like TCP does. Therefor packets may be dropped and are never recovered.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/28/understanding-udp/udp-communication/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/udp-communication.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;The UDP Communication Progress&#34; title=&#34;UDP Communication&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although this may sound like a bad thing, it depends on your network application. Some common network applications that use UDP include: the Domain Name System (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System&#34; title=&#34;Domain Name System&#34;&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;), streaming media applications such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTV&#34; title=&#34;IPTV&#34;&gt;IPTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP&#34; title=&#34;Voice over IP&#34;&gt;Voice over IP (VoIP)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Trivial File Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;Trivial File Transfer Protocol&lt;/a&gt; (TFTP) and online games. Looking at the UDP header there is a lot less overhead when compared to TCP, this makes UDP faster for routers to route the information with less overhead on processing power. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/28/understanding-udp/udp-header/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/udp-header.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;The UDP Header Field&#34; title=&#34;UDP Header&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because if dropped packets means less delayed information then UDP it is. In connectionless protocols there is no effort made to set up a connection like TCP, UDP just sends the information in one direction from the source address to the destination address and hopes it arrives in complete package but if not, the protocol does not care. So to review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UDP is Unreliable - When a message is sent, it cannot or will not know if it will reach its destination; it could get lost along the way. There is no concept of acknowledgment, re-transmission and or timeout like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Transmission Control Protocol&#34;&gt;TCP protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UDP is not ordered - If two messages are sent to the same destination, the order in which they arrive cannot be predicted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UDP is lightweight - There is no ordering of messages, any tracking connections, etc. It is a small transport layer designed on top of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol&#34;&gt;IP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside UDP &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram&#34; title=&#34;Datagram&#34;&gt;Datagrams&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_%28information_technology%29&#34; title=&#34;Packet (information technology)&#34;&gt;Packets&lt;/a&gt; that are sent individually and are guaranteed to be whole if they arrive. Packets have definite bounds and do not split or merge into data streams. (Meaning that UDP packets are not coherent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s UDP is in a summary format, I hope this information is useful and like always look at other sources like Cisco.com or do a simple web search. Comments are encourage, so let me know how I&#39;m  doing if you have a topic that is related to the ICND1 or ICND2 let me know about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Common Network Attacks</title>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Network attacks have always been around but they are getting more advanced every day. These attacks are also easy to set up and use. In the past these types of attacks would have to be pulled off by someone who really knew about computers and to know what they are doing. That&#39;s a true hacker, now there are programs that do the same damage and sometimes more with a couple clicks of a mouse, so now anybody can bring down a network. The only thing that changes is the motivation of the person. Some People that run scripts or programs don&#39;t always know what the program does, so they click on some buttons and the program does its thing, if it fails sometimes the person stops there and gives up. But there are people who want to do some real damage to a company these people usually have organizations like the Anonymous group. So what are some of the common attacks people or organizations do? Well in a company the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator&#34; title=&#34;Network administrator&#34;&gt;network administrators&lt;/a&gt; might focus on the outside of the network, but have their inside network unsecure or extremely weak. So if somebody on the inside was able to execute and attack it could have a huge effect on the network. So attacks that could occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconnaissance Attacks: Gather information about the network, this could be anything from ping sweeps, to port scanners, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol&#34;&gt;IP&lt;/a&gt; scanners, etc. The goal of this type of attack to gather information on the network and exploit its weak areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access Attacks: Try to steal or attempt to steal data. Financial information, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information&#34; title=&#34;Classified information&#34;&gt;classified information&lt;/a&gt;, critical information and even international espionage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denial of service (DoS) attacks. Which has three types of DoS types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroyers: which harm computers, by erasing data and software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crashers: cause harm by causing computers to fail or causing the machine to be unable to commutate with the network or connect to the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flooders: Flood the network with packets to make the network unusable and preventing any useful communication making the service appear unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer viruses are one of the many tools that could be used to carry out these types of attacks. Along with access to unsecured wireless networks. This makes the network weak if the computer or host is able to access ever device on that network. Infected laptops if the user brings the computer home from the office, that computer could get infected and exposing classified information and even have the potential to infect other computers. Employees could with or without knowing that what they download or save on USBs could cause harm to the company. A good security policy is recommended along with some helpful network access tools and components. These security tools can always stop attacks but they can slow somebody down and maybe be alerted to higher authority. Viruses are a common thing to get on a computer that is not protected with antivirus software or that virus could be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack&#34; title=&#34;Zero-day attack&#34;&gt;zero-day attack&lt;/a&gt; so the software does not have the virus in its signature database. But there are more than just viruses out there like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scanners: Are a tool that sends connection requests to a different &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Transmission Control Protocol&#34;&gt;TCP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;User Datagram Protocol&#34;&gt;UDP port&lt;/a&gt;, different applications. This attempt tries to discover which hosts or computers have IP services and possibly the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spyware: A virus that looks for private or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_sensitivity&#34; title=&#34;Information sensitivity&#34;&gt;sensitive information&lt;/a&gt;, like tracking websites the user visits. What the user does with the computer, and passing that information back to the attacker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worm: A self-propagating program that can quickly spread and copy itself around the network or even the internet. This type of program also can do &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack&#34; title=&#34;Denial-of-service attack&#34;&gt;DoS attacks&lt;/a&gt; on servers and computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keystroke Loggers: A virus that logs all keystrokes, capturing your username and passwords to secure sites. Giving the attacker access to your personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phishing: The attacker sets up a fake website that looks exactly like a legitimate website often from banks and or credit card companies. Sometimes the user will get an e-mail and a link to the website, the user clicks on the link and is directed to the fake website. The user then puts in login information or personal information. Giving the attack access to the user&#39;s bank or personal information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is brief it gives you an overview of the different types of security attacks network and host based. This can go into a lot more information and if you want to find more information about an attack and the ways to stop or slow down the attack a simple web search will be able to point you in the right direction. If you have any questions or comments feel to comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How a Router Routes</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/16/how-a-router-routes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2011 17:30:42 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/16/how-a-router-routes/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;This tutorial will be going over the basic information of how a router routes &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Internet Protocol&#34;&gt;IP packets&lt;/a&gt;. Routers are used in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI layer&lt;/a&gt; three or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Network Layer&#34;&gt;network layer&lt;/a&gt;. These routers have IP addresses and forward IP packets to the proper destination. This guide is somewhat basic and is assuming you have some information of how &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP addressing&lt;/a&gt; works and along with what routing protocols are. So let&#39;s focus first on how a host or a computer forwards traffic and then look at how a router forwards traffic. Computers forward or send packets based on these two steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the destination IP address is in the same network or subnet as PC-1 then send the packet directly to that host (without the routers help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If PC-1 does not have the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; to the destination host (PC-2) then it will send an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Address Resolution Protocol&#34;&gt;ARP&lt;/a&gt; request to get the MAC address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/16/how-a-router-routes/arp-message/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/arp-message.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;ARP Message (Broadcast)&#34; title=&#34;ARP-Message&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/arp-message.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For example PC-1 (192.168.1.1) is trying to send to PC-2 (192.1681.2) since both of these computers are on the same network, (PC-1 checks the destination &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork&#34; title=&#34;Subnetwork&#34;&gt;subnet mask&lt;/a&gt; and IP address to see if they are on the same network which they are) if PC-1 knows the MAC address of PC-2 it will put the IP address of PC-2 in the destination address field along with other information not related to this tutorial and forward the packet. If PC-1 does not know the MAC address it will send and ARP request, what this request does is send a broadcast message to all other &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt; and devices connected on the 192.168.1.0 network. This message wants to find the MAC address of the host connected to 192.168.1.2, once PC-2 gets the message it will send its MAC address to PC-1. PC-1 will then forward the packet to PC-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the destination IP address is not in the same subnet or network has PC-1 then PC-1 will send the packet to its default gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If PC-1 does not have the MAC address to the default gateway (R1) then send a ARP request to get the MAC address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example PC-1 (192.168.1.1) is trying to send to R1 (192.168.1.254) because the packet is not in the same network, PC-1&#39;s main goal is to send to a webserver (154.63.2.1) (PC-1 checks the destination subnet mask and IP address to see if they are on the same network which they are not) if PC-1 knows the MAC address of R1 it will put the IP address of R1 in the destination address field along with other information not related to this tutorial, and forward the packet. If PC-1 does not know the MAC address it will send and ARP request, what this request does is send a broadcast message to all other PCs and devices connected on the 192.168.1.0 network. This message wants to find the MAC address of the host connected to 192.168.1.254, once R1 gets the message it will send its MAC address to PC-1. PC-1 will then forward the packet/frame. Once the frame is received by R1 the router will first check the data-link FCS field. If the frame received errors the router will drop the packet. If the frame has no errors the router will rip off the old data link header and trailer and then look at the IP packet. The router then compares the IP packet&#39;s destination address. If the router has the IP address in its routing table the router will encapsulate the IP packet inside a new data link layer header and trailer and forward it out the correct interface, thus forwarding the frame. Confusued? Let&#39;s go into some more detail of what happened. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/16/how-a-router-routes/route-example/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/route-example.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Route-Example&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Looking at the topology PC-1 wants to send a packet to the web server. Since the web server is not on PC-1&#39;s network it will need to send the packet to its default gateway which is R1. PC-1 will build an IP packet with the destination IP address of the web server (154.63.2.1). PC-1 sends this has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet frame&#34;&gt;Ethernet frame&lt;/a&gt; with the destination IP address of R1 and has the MAC address of R1. R1 receives the frame and because the MAC address matches R1, the router will copy the frame and process it. R1 checks the FCS and no errors have occurred, next the router will then discard the old Ethernet header and trailer. R1 will compare the address and see if it has a match in its routing table; if there is not match the router will drop the frame. However the router finds an entry in its table to (154.63.2.1) the frame is forwarded out the router serial interface. The router encapsulates the packet and forwards out serial interface in an HDLC frame towards the next router. This will repeat the same steps in each router as along as the routers have a route to that destination it will then eventually be received by the router connected to the web server. This router will send an ARP message that wants to know who is 154.63.2.1? That broadcast message will be received by all devices connected to the 154.63.2.0 network. The web server will respond and send the MAC address to the router and the router will then forward the packet to the web server. That&#39;s the basic understanding of how routers forward traffic, this tutorial only scratched the surface with how routers route along with keeping it simple some things were skipped in this tutorial. If you would like to find more information take a look at Cisco.com which is a great place to get started. Questions or comments are also welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackTrack&#34; title=&#34;BackTrack&#34;&gt;BackTrack&lt;/a&gt; is Linux  &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security&#34; title=&#34;Network security&#34;&gt;network security&lt;/a&gt; audit tool for security professionals. This tool is used for testing and penetrating networks. That being said** This tutorial is for educational use only. This is meant only to teach that WEP is an insecure option, and is recommend to use a harder encryption. Using this tutorial on a network that you do not have permission to access or is not yours, could be illegal! ** This was tested on BackTrack version 4 and the steps outlined in this tutorial were successful. (this tutorial is assuming that you have BackTrack 4 installed and are ready with a shell prompt)  The first thing you want to do is start your wireless interface in most cases this is wlan0 [code]airmon-ng start wlan0[/code] In the output look for the monitor interface in most cases this is mon0   The next thing you want to do is copy down the target AP&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29&#34; title=&#34;Service set (802.11 network)&#34;&gt;ESSID&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; of the AP,  also copy down the channel of the target AP.  [code]airodump-ng mon0[/code] There must be a client or clients using the AP if not you can&#39;t crack it. Match the MAC address of the AP to the available clients you have listed.   Next only output what you want (for example I have an AP on channel 8 and that MAC address of the AP is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and it&#39;s out monitor 0) the command would be:       [code]airodump-ng --channel 8 --write output --bssid 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 mon0[/code] (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is you want to associate your wireless card with the AP(for example I have the AP&#39;s MAC and ESSID (which is test) and my wireless MAC address (which is aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -1 0 -e test -a 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is start the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_injection&#34; title=&#34;Packet injection&#34;&gt;packet injection&lt;/a&gt; (for example you will need the target AP&#39;s MAC address (which is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and my(yours) wireless MAC address (which is 00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h 00:55:bb:DD:FF mon0[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The final step depends were the outputs are saved and the name of the output (for this example they were on /root and the name of the file was output-01.cap) so the command would look like:     [code]aircrack-ng output-01.cap[/code] Again this depends were the file was saved it could be in a different location. But after that command aircrack will attempt to crack the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy&#34; title=&#34;Wired Equivalent Privacy&#34;&gt;WEP key&lt;/a&gt; it will tell you that it either failed or if it was able to find it. (If it does fail wait for more packets and try again.)   The way aircrack works is that it reads the packet injection file, (this file is continues to update as packets move across the network) aircrack then finds the common key because that key is sent back and forth in the network. Depending on how active the network is aircrack is able to find the key in less than a minute!   Keep in mind when I was setting this up on a test AP I did run into some difficulties, although cracking a WEP key is relatively easy it still took me some time in troubleshooting. I hope this tutorial is helpful, you can find more information at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&lt;/a&gt; Also check my tutorial on &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/&#34; title=&#34;Install BackTrack&#34;&gt;Installing BackTrack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cisco IDS vs. IPS</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/09/cisco-ids-vs.-ips/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;There are tons of network attacks out there. Using a firewall helps but does look for signature based attacks. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list&#34; title=&#34;Access control list&#34;&gt;Access Control Lists&lt;/a&gt; are like firewalls and only look at the protocols like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;File Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;FTP&lt;/a&gt; POP, etc. Cisco has developed some tools that will help &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator&#34; title=&#34;Network administrator&#34;&gt;network administrators&lt;/a&gt; combat the issue; IDS, (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion detection system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Detection System&lt;/a&gt;) and IPS. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion prevention system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Prevention System&lt;/a&gt;) Let&#39;s go into IDS first, Cisco IDS is a physical device and is like an alarm system it will alert you when an attack happens but that&#39;s it, the system won&#39;t block the connection. The IDS system is deployed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode&#34; title=&#34;Promiscuous mode&#34;&gt;promiscuous mode&lt;/a&gt; meaning the sensor is placed where it can hear all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic_control&#34; title=&#34;Network traffic control&#34;&gt;network traffic&lt;/a&gt; but is not in direct connect with the network making it an advantage when using an IDS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact, latency, or jitters etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact if there is a sensor failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact if there is a sensor overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the IDS does have some disadvantages compared to IPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If packets trigger an alarm that&#39;s all it does is tell us that an attack is happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct tuning is required for valid and invalid packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company must have a well thought-out security policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networks that are vulnerable must have evasion techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can IPS do that IDS can&#39;t? Well the IPS system can alert just like IDS but the IPS system can also block the attack. Remember that the IDS system can only alert. IPS works inline with the network it is a physical device just like IDS but is directly connected to the network. So what are the advantages to IPS compared to IDS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stops packets that trigger an alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can use stream normalization techniques (since the IPS sensor is inline with the traffic it can reduce many network attacks that exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the IDS the IPS does have disadvantage when compared to IDS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the sensor is connected directly (inline) with the network it might affect network traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sensor is overloaded that will also impact the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company must have a thought-out security policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be some latency, jitter etc. with the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why use IPS instead of IDS? Well IDS is an older technology and like mentioned before IDS only alerts you that an attack is happening, it logs the attack and that&#39;s it. Network attacks can happen fast and some of them only need a small amount of time to complete the attack. So once a network technician gets into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware&#34; title=&#34;Networking hardware&#34;&gt;network equipment&lt;/a&gt; the attacker could be long gone and got what he/she needed. Sure you can now fix the problem but it might be little too late. IPS is able to load signature files this is like the definitions on your anti-virus software which it looks for patterns based on the attack. Which IPS can take that same style and block those attacks based on the security policies you implement, along with alerting you of what happened. That&#39;s my brief rundown of what these two technologies do  there is a lot more information you will be able to find on the web. But both have their places in the networking environment and it all depends on the money the company wants to spend to keep their networks secure. You can find more information at Cisco.com and or other places, I hope this information was informative.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, (March 3rd 2011) there was a massive &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack&#34; title=&#34;Denial-of-service attack&#34;&gt;DoS attack&lt;/a&gt; that hit &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.com/&#34; title=&#34;WordPress.com&#34;&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt;. Cisco Skill&#39;s uses WordPress.com has a hosting provider but is not believed to one of the sites hit. There still is no word on who or why they targeted WordPress.com but goes to show that Denial of Service is still a popular type of attack and although simple to set up they can still bring down enterprise networks. So what exactly is denial of service? To make it simple a denial of service can be a range of things but the main goal of a DoS attack is to slow the network down so real traffic can&#39;t get access or is extremely unresponsive. One example is using the one of the TCP services and do a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood&#34; title=&#34;SYN flood&#34;&gt;SYN flood&lt;/a&gt;, which a host or thousands of hosts send thousands of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Transmission Control Protocol&#34;&gt;SYN packets&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29&#34; title=&#34;Server (computing)&#34;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;. The server sends a SYN ACK but the host does not respond leaving the session open until a timeout occurs. By having all these fake sessions open the server may not be able to handle additional traffic making it seem the service is unavailable. There are many more types of denial of service attacks and the SYN flood is just one example. [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_840&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;Credit: Cisco Inc.&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/04/wordpress-com-hit-by-a-dos-attack/syn-attack/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/syn-attack.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SYN Flood Attack&#34; title=&#34;SYN Attack&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] These DoS attacks have been around for a while and they are relatively easy to set up and configure. An attacker could infect machines with a virus that the user or anti-software is unaware of its existence. The virus waits until it has been activated by the remote attacker. This virus could have spread to hundreds of thousands of machines and are waiting for the attacker to start the attack once activated the denial of service starts and the attacker can pick which target to bring down. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&#34; title=&#34;Matt Mullenweg&#34;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; the founder of WordPress.com wrote an e-mail sent to CNET.com and said the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s an ongoing DDoS attack that was large enough to impact all three of our data centers in Chicago, San Antonio, and Dallas--it&#39;s currently been neutralized but it&#39;s possible it could flare up again later, which we&#39;re taking proactive steps to implement. This is the largest and most sustained attack we&#39;ve seen in our six-year history. We suspect it may have been politically motivated against one of our non-English blogs but we&#39;re still investigating and have no definitive evidence yet.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btinstallp3/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a full install of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&#34; title=&#34;BackTrack&#34;&gt;BackTrack&lt;/a&gt; 4 this can be in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine&#34; title=&#34;Virtual machine&#34;&gt;virtual machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_boot&#34; title=&#34;Multi boot&#34;&gt;dual-boot&lt;/a&gt;, or the main &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system&#34; title=&#34;Operating system&#34;&gt;OS&lt;/a&gt;. So you burned the image that you downloaded from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&lt;/a&gt;  and are ready to go! If not I would recommend you do that first. BackTrack is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kernel.org/&#34; title=&#34;Linux&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; penetration testing for network security. This is a free tool that IT administrators can use to audit their network.   First put the disk into the tray and restart your computer. This depends on your &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS&#34; title=&#34;BIOS&#34;&gt;BIOS setup&lt;/a&gt; but you can either set the boot order or go into a boot menu and select the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc&#34; title=&#34;Compact Disc&#34;&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt; tray as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting&#34; title=&#34;Booting&#34;&gt;boot device&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the first thing you will see when you boot into BackTrack you can play around with the different options later but select the screen resolution that is close to your screen size.   &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/backtrack-1/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/backtrack-1.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;backtrack Main&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Once you select the option you want you will see a loading page, this can take some time so be patient!   &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/backtrack-load/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/backtrack-load.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;backtrackLoad&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Once backtrack is done loading then you can start from there and have fun with command-line but if your &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface&#34; title=&#34;Command-line interface&#34;&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt; skills are a little rusty then you can go into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&#34; title=&#34;Graphical user interface&#34;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; by typing &lt;em&gt;startx&lt;/em&gt; and hit enter. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/backtrack-loadst/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/backtrack-loadst.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;backtrack loadst&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; From here you can run BackTrack now (it’s called a Live CD) &lt;em&gt;this could be useful if you just want to look at it and play around with settings that you have no idea what they are or do. That why if you mess something up you can always restart and go back into it without it saving anything!&lt;/em&gt; But let’s install this thing! Click on the Install.sh icon.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/install-shell/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/install-shell.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;install shell&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  This next window is the installer, it is pretty simple to understand, you want to select your location that is in the same time-zone as you.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btinstallp1/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/btinstallp1.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Install Page 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  This next window is the keyboard layout, Usually USA works for me. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btinstallp2/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/btinstallp2.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;install page 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  This next page is the partition manager thing, from here you can dual-boot if you have another OS. (You want to be careful if you do have another OS on the hardrive because you can wipe your other OS from here) For this example I am taking the whole drive.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btinstallp3/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/btinstallp3.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;install page 3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The next page gives you a review before you start installing BackTrack this is also a good time to make sure everything is set up properly before you install BackTrack &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btinstallp4/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/btinstallp4.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;installpage 4&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  After you click install the installer will start installing!! (amazing! right!) Here you can watch the bar go across the screen or do something productive in this timeframe it takes about 20 to 30 minutes but this also depends on the hardware you have.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btinstallp5/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/btinstallp5.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;installpage 5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  After it finishes it gives you two options, stay on the live CD or reboot to start BackTrack. &lt;em&gt;(Hint: reboot)&lt;/em&gt;   Once the machine is rebooting it will take some time so be patient as it is loading. Once it is ready it will ask you for your username and password. The username is &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; and the password is &lt;em&gt;toor .&lt;/em&gt; Once you type that you&#39;re in CLI again, if you want to go to the GUI just type &lt;em&gt;startx&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btstart/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/btstart.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;backtrack start&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Once you type &lt;em&gt;startx&lt;/em&gt; it will load the GUI and you now have a full install of BackTrack! From here you can go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&lt;/a&gt; for more information on how to audit your network.&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/btstartdesk/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/btstartdesk.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;backtrackdesk&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I hope this tutorial was helpful&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Corporation&#34; title=&#34;Intel Corporation&#34;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; announced on Friday (February 25th 2011) the new high speed connector that will coexists with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus&#34; title=&#34;Universal Serial Bus&#34;&gt;USB 3.0&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.&#34; title=&#34;Apple Inc.&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; also announced that it will be appearing first on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro&#34; title=&#34;MacBook Pro&#34;&gt;MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. Thunderbolt known before has &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Peak&#34; title=&#34;Light Peak&#34;&gt;Light Peak&lt;/a&gt; is a new high-speed PC connection &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology&#34; title=&#34;Technology&#34;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;. This cable can combine data and high-definition all in one cable running at 10Gbps. So you could say it is like the all in wonder &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI&#34; title=&#34;HDMI&#34;&gt;HDMI cable&lt;/a&gt; that combines video and audio into one cable. How fast is 10Gbps? Well if you had a full length HD movie so on average 120 minutes it would be able to transfer that movie in less than 30 seconds!! Although the codename was called Light Peak Intel Is running the new technology as an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current&#34; title=&#34;Electric current&#34;&gt;electrical current&lt;/a&gt; based on copper. Intel has said that it will work and move the technology over to optical but not schedule has been released yet. This Thunderbolt technology will not replace USB 3.0 according to Jason Ziller, an Intel manager, &amp;quot;They will co-exist on the same platform...in terms of storage (devices) we&#39;ll see both products on the market&amp;quot;. You can read more information at Intel&#39;s website in the press room about the Thunderbolt Technology. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011/02/24/thunderbolt-technology-the-fastest-data-connection-to-your-pc-just-arrived?cid=rss-258152-c1-264729&#34;&gt;Thunderbolt Technology: The Fastest Data Connection to Your PC Just Arrived&lt;/a&gt;) This technology is pretty cool, but the question is will it take off. Consumers have to buy it in order for it to be a success. Also Apple kind of took the product, although Apple did have some say in the Thunderbolt Technology it feels like at least for now that only Apple will have this. I am throwing a guess that other manufactures are waiting to see if this is a hit or a flop. What do think? Comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>802.11ac Standard</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/21/802.11ac-standard/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Some things are making news in the wireless world, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers&#34; title=&#34;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#34;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; wants another wireless standard in the mix called the  802.11ac, now the fastest standard they have is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11n-2009&#34;&gt;802.11n&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed&#34; title=&#34;Speed&#34;&gt;speeds&lt;/a&gt; up to 300 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units&#34; title=&#34;Data rate units&#34;&gt;Mbps&lt;/a&gt;), which was recently published in October of 2009. What is so great about the 802.11ac development? Well one thing is the speed, it is estimated that it will be able to carry up to 1 gigabit per second! The IEEE has been working on 802.11ac in 2009 and wants to put up a draft on it soon (this year). Products are not yet ready but could be around 2012. It is estimated that a billion 802.11ac devices could be expected in 2015. The standard will be using the existing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Radio spectrum&#34;&gt;radio spectrum&lt;/a&gt; in ranges below 6GHz and reports say it will have &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility&#34; title=&#34;Backward compatibility&#34;&gt;backwards compatibility&lt;/a&gt; for older devices. Frank Dickson said, “The goal of 802.11ac is to provide data speeds faster than 802.11n, with speeds of around 1Gbps,&amp;quot; he continued and said, “The timing for 802.11ac approval is to have a draft standard created by 2011 and have the first 802.11ac products out by the end of 2012.&amp;quot; So what does this mean to the average person? Well for the home user they probably would not see a difference if they were browsing online since &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider&#34; title=&#34;Internet service provider&#34;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; connection speeds are usually slower than LAN (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network&#34; title=&#34;Local area network&#34;&gt;Local Area Network&lt;/a&gt;) speeds. If the average person was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media&#34; title=&#34;Streaming media&#34;&gt;streaming videos&lt;/a&gt; from another computer within his home or transferring large files they would see a difference. This would be more towards businesses that don’t want to run cables to each computer, and would be more geared to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device&#34; title=&#34;Mobile device&#34;&gt;mobile devices&lt;/a&gt; like tablets, phones, laptops etc. Not much information is available as the 802.11ac is still under development. Which makes room for changing, but if you want to check out more information you can head over to the IEEE site at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ieee.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.ieee.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistency on Linux</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/04/persistency-on-linux/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Many popular Linux OS can be installed on USB, and have persistency (Data and or settings) saved on that USB. So in the end you have a “almost installed” OS on your USB. This tutorial focuses on BackTrack but you can put other Linux OS like, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Open SUSE, and many more can be used as well. First and the easiest way I found was running a program called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linuxliveusb.com/&#34;&gt;Linux Live USB Creator&lt;/a&gt;. This program can put together a LiveUSB (in which data cannot be saved, like a Live CD) or also put persistency on (which allows you to save file and settings). The only thing you can’t usually do with a persistency system is update system settings, and sometimes installing additional software. This program can also put up a portable Virtual Box so you don’t have to restart your system to use it. So the first thing to do is to download and install Linux Live USB Creator, follow the simple setup information to install Linux Live After you install Linux Live you can start-up the program and choose your USB drive.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/persistency-on-linux/lili-usb/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lili-usb.png?w=90&#34; alt=&#34;Linux Live USB Program&#34; title=&#34;Linux Live USB Program&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Next choose the source of the .iso file, you can even download the .iso from here as well. For this example I was trying out BackTrack 4, So I selected backtrack. (Many other Linux OS are available)   &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/persistency-on-linux/source/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/source.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;ISO Source File&#34; title=&#34;Source&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The next one is persistency this allows you to actually save data on the USB. You can then boot that USB from multiple machines and you settings and files should be there. Select how much space you want for persistency. If you set it to zero it will be a LiveUSB. &lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/persistence.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Persistence Level&#34; title=&#34;Persistence&#34;&gt;Next are options and are totally up to you, (what I did was select every one of them when I installed BackTrack4)   &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/persistency-on-linux/options/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/options.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Options&#34; title=&#34;Options&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then after all the selections have been made hit that lightning bolt!   &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/persistency-on-linux/startnow/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/startnow.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;To Start Click the Lighting Bolt&#34; title=&#34;Start Now&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Once completed you can either start the OS within Windows from the portal VM, or reboot and select you USB drive to boot and you now should have a persistent system up and running.   (For BackTrack4 I have found that you need to select “Start Persistent Live CD” in order for the persistent mode to start and save data.)   You can find more information on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linuxliveusb.com/&#34;&gt;Linux Live USB Creator’s&lt;/a&gt; website. I hope this tutorial was helpful&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IPv4 Meet IPv6</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/03/ipv4-meet-ipv6/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;IPv4 maybe on its last leg with only a few blocks of IPv4 addresses available, computer estimates say that the IANA address depletion was January 27, 2011. Also the calculations for all central IPv4 pool addresses will be depleted by July 25, 2012. These are estimates and may change as of writing this post. I&#39;ll be sure to update if needed, but the thing to understand is that IPv4 won&#39;t be available within weeks if not months. So what happens then? Well we move into IPv6 which has the capacity to hold 2^128th addresses that number is  340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456. If you want to know what that number is called it is 340 undecillion, 282 decillion, 366 nonillion, 920 octillion, 938 septillion, 463 sextillion, 463 quintillion, 374 quadrillion, 607 trillion, 431 billion, 768 million, 211 thousand and 456 addresses. These address are in hexadecimal form and are 128 bits in length compared to IPv4 which is in a 32 bits in length. One problem with IPv4 and IPv6 is they don&#39;t get along, they are not backwards compatible. You can either go to IPv6, IPv4 or dual stack the technology. This can be a problem if computer industries did not make a plan beforehand and are now scrambling to implement IPv6. Experts have known that the IPv4 address space would run out the only issue was &amp;quot;when&amp;quot;. That&#39;s why IPv6 was design in the 1990s. To help companies test and configure IPv6 the Internet Society is helping to organize the World IPv6 Day. On June 8, companies like Google and Yahoo and distributors like Akamai and Limelight Networks will offer their services over IPv6 for 24 hours for evaluation and troubleshooting sessions. What about users? Well if you have a recent operating system like Windows XP, Vista and 7 IPv6 is ready to go, if not already running on your computer. So your computer can handle it. The only problem is your Internet Service Provider and or DSL and cable modem. One test you can do is at this site &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.test-ipv6.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.test-ipv6.com/&lt;/a&gt;. It will be able to tell you if you can access both IPv4 and IPv6 sites or only IPv4 or IPv6. Today at 9:30am Eastern Standard Time the Number Resource Organization (NRO), along with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the Internet Society (ISOC) and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) will be holding a ceremony and press conference to make a significant announcement and to discuss the global transition to the next generation of Internet addresses. You can check out the live webcast at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nro.net/news/icann-nro-live-stream&#34;&gt;http://www.nro.net/news/icann-nro-live-stream&lt;/a&gt;  Personally I can&#39;t wait for IPv6 it really is a totally different internet protocol and does have benefits in moving from IPv4 to IPv6. Like less overhead in the packet format and forwarding, and introduces a mandatory Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) which is optional in IPv4. These are some of the many improvements that IPv6 has in comparison to IPv4. Sure there might be problems with customers and service providers but if you ISP did their job you as a user should not even notice a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Common Weaknesses Cybercriminals Exploit</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/01/27/common-weaknesses-cybercriminals-exploit/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;While reading the Cisco Annual Report they came up with seven common social engineering attacks that cybercriminals use. Now these types of attacks are common and are not unheard of. You should be familiar with most if not all these weaknesses that cybercriminals use.  Sex appeal, which means scammers will try to find or put up attractive man or woman. Then tempt the user for information. People should remember if you don&#39;t know the person this will more than likely not be romance but something else. (Like your personal information) Greed, there is this saying and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of  it, &amp;quot;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is&amp;quot;. This could be anything from a free iPod offer, to those Nigerian wire transfer offers. Don&#39;t provide them with your personal information! Vanity, which means you have been chosen or that you are a winner in some contest that you did not enter. Or that you have been selected in a group of winners and are receiving a share. Again these types of scams are meant to give your personal information away to somebody you don&#39;t know. Trust, which  can be implied or transient. Implied is the attempt to convince individuals that they represent a high-profile brand. (Apple, Microsoft, Dell, HP) and therefore can be trusted. With transient trust scammers pretend to be a trusted companion of someone you know but have never heard of them. Users should always be aware that anything that involves a trust relationship should send some flags. Laziness, this could be anything from misspellings in e-mails, messages, and websites. If the URL in the website is misspelled or that e-mail from your bank. Those should be warnings that the information is also fake. Compassion, scammers love those kindhearted people. This could be anything from nonexistent nonprofits, such like major disasters. (Like the earthquake in Haiti) Along with the 2009 scam that involved Facebook. Hijacking users’ accounts then posting and claiming that the account holder was stranded somewhere and needed money. Users should be aware and maintain a high level of skepticism toward these types of messages. Urgency, there are tons of scams that insist on a fast response and tell the potential victim to “act now” or that “time is running out.” These types of messages don&#39;t always come in e-mails or the web. There are phone calls claiming they need personal or company files. Users should always check the company and should never feel pressured to respond immediately. Always be aware of these weaknesses and if and doubt don&#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ubuntu 10.10 Install</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10.10-install/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2011 16:30:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10.10-install/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Well a while back I went ahead and downloaded the RC version of Ubuntu 10.10 and played around with it. Yes that&#39;s right the RC version. Now there is a final version of 10.10 which was released on the 10th of October 2010. I saw that very little has changed between the RC and the final version when installing. I know this is a little late going and doing a step by step install of Ubuntu, but never seems to get old. So I took some screen shots of the install and the desktop when finished. So let’s get installing!   When you first put the disk in along with booting from the disk you are welcomed at the welcome screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_welcome/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_welcome.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Welcome Page&#34; title=&#34;Welcome Page&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you can select your language and choose if you want to run it from the disk or install it on the hardrive. (I like how Ubuntu and other Linux software let users run the operating system from the disk that&#39;s always a helpful thing when you may have problems with your other OS) The next page if you selected install is in overview of the system requirements. This tells you that everything should go or not go as planned. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_installp1/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp1.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Install Page 1&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (1)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_installp2/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp2.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Install Page 2&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (2)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When you click forward you then have an option to use the whole hardrive or set up a partition. For this step-by step guide I just selected the whole disk, it all depends if you have another OS on your computer or if you want to wipe your drive completely.&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_installp3/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp3.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Install Page 3&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (3)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The next step is allocating the drive. Again this all depends on your current setup (I used the whole disk for this demo) Once you have the drives set up select install now. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_installp4/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp4.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Ubuntu Install Page 4&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (4)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_installp5/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp5.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Install Page 5&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (5)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Throughout the install process it will ask you for your current location/time format. It also asks your keyboard layout, for this demo I selected USA. (This all depends on if you have a different keyboard usually USA is the default) The next screen will want your login information this is based on how you want Ubuntu to login and the user to login as. You can select to login automatically and even encrypt your home folder for security. Type a user name (mine is Ryan) and a password. (For this demo notice how my password is weak, I would recommend using a stronger password)  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_installp6/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp6.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Ubuntu Install Page 6&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (6)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Also when Ubuntu installs you can click on the arrows to learn more about it while you are waiting for it to install. On the virtual PC it took about 30 minutes to install but remember this depends on hardware.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_installp7/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp7.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Install Page 7&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (7)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_installp7.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Once Ubuntu installs you have to restart the computer a message like this will pop up when the install is finished.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_intallp8/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_intallp8.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Install Page 8&#34; title=&#34;Install Page (8)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_intallp8.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Once restarted this is the login screen for Ubuntu. (This depends on if you selected requiring Ubuntu to show the login screen.)&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_login/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_login.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Ubuntu Login Page&#34; title=&#34;Ubuntu 10.10 Login Page&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the Ubuntu 10.10 desktop after a clean install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_main_desktop/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_main_desktop.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Ubuntu 10.10 Main Desktop&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_main_desktop.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Update Manger provides updates for Ubuntu. (Notice how many updates I have over 150 of them! Some of them are probably not important...I hope! ) &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_update/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_update.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Ubuntu Update&#34; title=&#34;Ubuntu Update &#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_update.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is Ubuntu&#39;s Software Center, you will find free and some paid software to download and install! There is a lot of software for just about anything out there.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_softwarecenter/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_softwarecenter.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Ubuntu Software Center&#34; title=&#34;Ubuntu 10.10 Software Center&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_softwarecenter.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is Ubuntu&#39;s folder view or explorer window, nice and neat, organized and pretty simple to understand. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-10-10-install/preview_folderexplorer_view/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_folderexplorer_view.png?w=150&#34; alt=&#34;Ubuntu (Explorer View)&#34; title=&#34;Ubuntu 10.10 folder (explorer_view)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/preview_folderexplorer_view.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Overall the Ubuntu&#39;s 10.10 version is pretty solid. Ubuntu has always had apps ready to go when it starts. Like e-mail and chat programs that work with MSN, Gmail, Yahoo and other e-mail services. Of course Ubuntu has browsers Firefox is included and Google Chrome is also supported along with flash. When using open source operating systems why not use open source office software? By using Open Office you can create professional documents and presentations and it&#39;s all included with Ubuntu. Ubuntu One which started in 9.04 is a cloud service that can help you sync your computers all together. You can buy music and have it on all computers and mobile phones that you own. Sharing files between them is also simple. Ubuntu is social friendly operating system it can access your Facebook, Twitter and Identi accounts all from one application on your computer. Ubuntu is pretty fast within 10 seconds I was at the login screen, within 5 seconds I was at my desktop and ready to go! Ubuntu has always been good to older computer platforms, they do however want Ubuntu on newer machines because of the added support of newer hardware. Games are important when you have time to burn and Ubuntu has hundreds of them. With Ubuntu creating photos and editing is easy with included software like Shotwell, Flickr, and GIMP. Support for camera and phones are legendary, all without drivers. These are some of the many features Ubuntu has, and has had for a while. Well that’s my take on the newer version of Ubuntu and looking at the release cycle the next version of Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) which is expected to be released April 28th 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
