          &lt;p&gt;On this Monday let&#39;s wrap up the 802.11 wireless standards, Friday I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11g-2003&#34;&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt; (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/08/802-11g/&#34; title=&#34;802.11g&#34;&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt;) and before that I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11b-1999&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/07/802-11b/&#34; title=&#34;802.11b&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; ) I also talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11a-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11a-1999&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;, (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/06/802-11a/&#34; title=&#34;802.11a&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;) I even talked about the 802.11 –Legacy (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/05/802-11-legacy/&#34; title=&#34;802.11 -Legacy&#34;&gt;802.11 –Legacy&lt;/a&gt;) and in the beginning of last week I talked about the basic wireless concepts. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) So let&#39;s end the discussion and talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11n-2009&#34;&gt;802.11n&lt;/a&gt; standard! You could say that the 802.11n standard is the best of both worlds in the 802.11 wireless standards. 802.11n was officially released in October of 2009 and can run in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz&lt;/a&gt; range and use the 5GHz range. Something that is special in the 802.11n standard is the use of multiple-input multiple-output (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO&#34; title=&#34;MIMO&#34;&gt;MIMO&lt;/a&gt;). MIMO is a technology which uses multiple antennas to gather more information essentially. It uses SDM Spatial Division Multiplexing to significantly increase the data throughput. Because of this technology 802.11n can in theory transfer speeds up to 300 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units&#34; title=&#34;Data rate units&#34;&gt;Mbps&lt;/a&gt;. 802.11n is also backwards compatible like the 802.11g standard it can also work with the 802.11b standard. 802.11n can also work with the 802.11a standard in the 5GHz range. Currently 802.11n is the fastest and has the longest range compared to the earlier 802.11 standards. 802.11n indoors has a range of about 230 feet, in outdoor environments the 802.11n has range of about 800 feet. We all know technology changes and a while ago I posted about the 802.11ac standard which does have the potential to travel in speeds up to 1Gbps! (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/21/802-11ac-standard/&#34; title=&#34;802.11ac Standard&#34;&gt;802.11ac Standard&lt;/a&gt;) For now that&#39;s my summary version of the 802.11n standard, like always I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/p&gt;

This post one of the five standards that make up the 802.11. The 802.11 – Legacy has its called now and is not in use anymore by manufactures and is now obsolete was the first wireless standard available for consumer laptops. When the 802.11 - Legacy came out in 1997 you could expect speeds up to 2 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units&#34; title=&#34;Data rate units&#34;&gt;megabits per second&lt;/a&gt; (Mbit/s) This standard was replaced quickly when &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11b-1999&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; was released. The legacy standard range was about 70 feet indoors and around 330 feet outdoors at the time that was huge! Currently the 802.11 legacy standard is the only standard that used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-hopping_spread_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Frequency-hopping spread spectrum&#34;&gt;Frequency-hopping spread spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. What this means is the device would switch frequencies to a different channel at random. This helped the signals become harder to intercept. The obsolete standard also could use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Direct-sequence spread spectrum&#34;&gt;Direct-sequence spread spectrum&lt;/a&gt; (DSSS) which had the benefits of Resistance to jamming, you could share the signal channel among other users, it reduced the signal and noise level which helped in interception. Although this standard is not in use anymore you could say that the wireless explosion was on the way and this is what started it. Check back tomorrow and I&#39;ll be posting the 802.11a standard. I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic I should do that deal with any ICND1 and ICND2 material.&lt;/h2&gt;
