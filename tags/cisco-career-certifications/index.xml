          &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to reference the CCNA Data Center (640-911) exam. This exam starts the conversation of IPv6 and since IPv6 is hexadecimal this post starts the talk about how we look at a hexadecimal values and learn how to convert them to binary and decimal. If you know subnetting skills then this won’t be that difficult. If you are new then check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/15/the-wonders-of-binary/&#34; title=&#34;The Wonders of Binary&#34;&gt;The Wonders of Binary&lt;/a&gt; post as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/04/01/part-1-the-joys-of-subnetting/&#34; title=&#34;Part 1 – The Joys of Subnetting!&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/04/23/part-2-the-joys-of-subnetttting-vlsm/&#34; title=&#34;Part 2 – The Joys of Subnetttting – VLSM!&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; of subnetting. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping right into it if we look at this hexadecimal value 0x56A we know it’s hexadecimal because the “0x” is the prefix for a hexadecimal number so we really don’t need to do anything with the “0x”. Let’s focus on the 56A value. So where do we start? Remember that 0-9 are normal decimal values so &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; actually means &amp;quot;5&amp;quot;. We want to convert these values into binary. Followed by converting them into a decimal value. So what does the value 5 look like in binary? We then move  to the next digit &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; what does that look like in binary? Then the last value is &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, what does that look like in binary? &lt;em&gt;Hint: A-F would be 10-15 in decimal.&lt;/em&gt; Reference chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEXADECIMAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DECIMAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BINARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0010&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0011&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0110&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1010&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1011&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1110&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at the value 56A we would want to combine all the single values into one binary string. (Example 5 in binary is: &lt;strong&gt;0101&lt;/strong&gt;, 6 in binary is: &lt;strong&gt;0110&lt;/strong&gt;, A in binary is: &lt;strong&gt;1010&lt;/strong&gt;) Combine these together and the the answer would be: &lt;strong&gt;01010110101&lt;/strong&gt; (You can drop leading zeros) &lt;strong&gt;1010110101&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does that value look like in decimal? Write it out and remember the power of 2s and always start with &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;. The answer comes out as: &lt;strong&gt;1,386.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ciscoskills.net/images/2015/04/binarye.png&#34; alt=&#34;Add up the 1s&#34;&gt;
Of course you can reverse engineer this if you were given a decimal value and needed to convert it into hexadecimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example convert the following decimal 187 into hexadecimal. Write out 187 into binary so that answer looks like: &lt;strong&gt;10111011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ciscoskills.net/images/2015/04/dec-binary2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You also want to split the binary string into equal parts, so the answer would be: &lt;strong&gt;1011:1011&lt;/strong&gt; comparing the chart or doing this yourself convert this binary into hexadecimal. Since binary strings are the same our hexadecimal is: &lt;strong&gt;BB.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ciscoskills.net/images/2015/04/dec-to-hex2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it! Understanding how to convert hex to decimal and back starts to get important when IPv6 shows up at the door. Although this is a fundamental level topic that&#39;s exactly why its important to understand it. Just like subnetting, I would use a calculator if you ever find yourself converting these values. It&#39;s always a good idea to double-check your work. However on the exam you don&#39;t have that pleasure so learning it the manual way is this only way. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cisco VIRL is out ... for a price</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2014/12/05/cisco-virl-is-out-...-for-a-price/</link>

          &lt;p&gt;Just wanted to put this up has Cisco has recently released VIRL. This is a network simulation platform that you can run Cisco operating systems on which are the same operating systems that run on Cisco hardware so anything you do in this simulation environment would be realistic if it was running on dedicated hardware. You would be able to test your changes before throwing them in production. Some things that are different between VIRL and CML (Cisco Modeling Labs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CML is Cisco TAC supported so you can call Cisco.  With VIRL you have community to help you out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have cap of 15 devices with VIRL. The CML version capacity is dependent on the hardware its running on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CML is  for the &amp;quot;Big Guys&amp;quot;, and way more expensive. VIRL is just for personal/training use. (i.e CCNA, CCNP, CCIE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be upfront I have not purchased VIRL so I can&#39;t tell you my thoughts on the product itself but personally I think this is great way to learn and study Cisco certifications when looking at CCNP and even CCIE. This is way cheaper than buying hardware or renting rack space. The price is $199.99 a year and I would assume this would cover any updates the product has. Cisco is also selling an Academic Version for $79.99 a year with some extra terms attached to it. I&#39;m curious if anybody has any thoughts on VIRL, what advantages do you think this network simulation program (VIRL) has compared to GNS3? What do you think VIRL&#39;s target audience is? Is this price too high? Finally do you think the product is too green? Are you going to buy it or wait and see?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GNS3 1.0 Public is Out</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2014/10/21/gns3-1.0-public-is-out/</link>

          &lt;p&gt;Get your IOS, IOU, XRV, 1000v, HP, Juniper, Arista, and other images ready because that&#39;s the beauty of GNS3, it&#39;s here and ready to download. I&#39;m excited for this release although the last post I did was In May of 2014, which was about getting GNS3 Alpha 3 working on Windows, you can see the full post here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2014/05/09/gns3-alpha-install-and-setup/&#34; title=&#34;GNS3 Alpha – Install and Setup&#34;&gt;GNS3 Alpha – Install and Setup&lt;/a&gt;. I have followed the GNS3 releases throughout the six months of them releasing Alpha and beta releases, as well as looking at changlogs of each release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the past six months we have seen some changes with the GNS3 team. The new logo, the new website, and of course the new 1.0 version of GNS3. They have also done a good job of setting up a new portal called the GNS3 Jungle which is for the community to ask all things networking all of which is available now. Check out all of it at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gns3.com&#34; title=&#34;GNS3&#34;&gt;http://www.gns3.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Currently the GNS3 website is a little slow because I think we are all excited for the new software and can&#39;t wait to get our hands on it but I was able to register so I&#39;ll be posting more about the new version of GNS3 so keep that in mind, and check me out the GNS3 Jungle &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.gns3.com/people/lewiryan&#34;&gt;lewiryan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again Stephen and Jeremy and the entire GNS3 team for building a great piece of software with the help of an awesome community. Another interesting read that I found was a post from &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkcanuck.com/&#34;&gt;NetworkCanuck&lt;/a&gt; about an Interview with Steven from GNS3, read it here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkcanuck.com/2014/10/20/gns3/&#34; title=&#34;GNS3 - An Interview&#34;&gt;GNS3 - An Interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ll end this post with what are you loading into GNS3?&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;ve played around with two Cisco Nexus 5672UP switches which will be in production soon but before that I wanted to see what it took to get enhanced vPC online. Along the way I was into some new territory as I never stood up vPC before, so in this post I have posted some things to keep in mind and running-config examples, all of which I hope is helpful for a reference. Before we go into the configuration of vPC I wanted to mentioned that the Nexus 5600 series switch is a newer product in the Cisco Data Center portfolio. I would guess that it would eventually replace the 5500 Nexus switch series but as of this writing Cisco has not put any end of life notice on the 5500 hardware. One of the main differences on the 5600 is the built-in layer 3 capabilities. The 5500 required a layer 3 card that used an expansion slot and only the higher-end Nexus products offered layer 3. To find out more information about the 5600 on Cisco&#39;s website: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/datasheet-c78-730760.html&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches Data Sheet&#34;&gt;Cisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches Data Sheet&lt;/a&gt; So when I was looking at configuration examples I noticed some confusion between a dual-homed FEX setup and an enhanced vPC setup, so I&#39;ll try to clear the air. The &amp;quot;Enhanced&amp;quot; vPC is able to set up an etherchannel link from two different Nexus switches. The host/server that connects to these two different Nexus switches must support Active/Active NICs. This configuration is almost the same if you were setting up a dual-homed FEX but with just Active/Passive NICs setup on the host/server. So here is a question if the configuration is almost the same what needs to be added to support enhanced vPC? The software I am working with is version 7.0(1)N1(1) and we need to enable the features of vpc, fex and lacp. [code]feature vpc feature fex feature lacp [/code] We also need to have some VLANs created on both 5ks. In this example I created 25-35 [code]vlan 25-35[/code] We need to start a VPC domain, this must be the same on both switches. SWITCH 1: [code] vpc domain 1 peer-keepalive destination 169.254.1.2 source 169.254.1.1 [/code] SWITCH 2: [code] vpc domain 1 peer-keepalive destination 169.254.1.1 source 169.254.1.2 [/code] A note about the peer-keepalive, the 5500/5600 Nexus has a dedicated management NIC card on the front of the unit. (Where the power is) The reason I did this was I did not want to waste a 10Gb connection for just a keep-alive link. (Although it can be done :/ )  In this example I don&#39;t have a &amp;quot;dedicated&amp;quot; management network so I decided to use the management NIC of both 5ks. By default you have a another vrf context called management on the 5ks running-config. So on both 5ks I give that vrf context an IP address and directly connected both 5ks together. SWITCH 1: [code] interface mgmt0 vrf member management ip address 169.254.1.1/24 [/code] SWITCH 2: [code] interface mgmt0 vrf member management ip address 169.254.1.2/24 [/code] Another helpful tip that I could not find out was if the management NICs would auto MDI/MDIX. So I just plugged in a straight-though and it works, so you don&#39;t need a crossover cable if you don&#39;t have one nearby. :) We now need to create a vPC peer-link between the two Nexus switches. In this example I am using two 10Gb links, which are the same interfaces on both Nexus switches. (Consistency is your friend) [code] interface Ethernet1/31 channel-group 1 mode active interface Ethernet1/32 channel-group 1 mode active [/code] Both switches are referring to port-channel one for interfaces 31 and 32. In the port-channel we will trunk the vlans we have created earlier along with setting this port-channel into a vpc peer-link. [code] interface port-channel1   switchport mode trunk   switchport trunk allowed vlan 25-35   vpc peer-link [/code] To keep the config short I am only referring to two FEXes in this example. (Remember so far in this post you would do exactly the same configuration if you just wanted to set up dual-homed FEXes) Starting with FEX 101 on SWITCH 1: [code] interface Ethernet1/1   description FEX-101-PORT-1   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface Ethernet1/2   description FEX-101-PORT-3   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface port-channel101   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101   vpc 101 [/code] Continue with FEX 101 on SWITCH 2: [code] interface Ethernet1/1   description FEX-101-PORT-2   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface Ethernet1/2   description FEX-101-PORT-4   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101 channel-group 101 interface port-channel101   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 101   vpc 101 [/code] Start with FEX 102 on SWITCH 1: [code] interface Ethernet1/3   description FEX-102-PORT-1   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface Ethernet1/4   description FEX-102-PORT-3   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface port-channel102   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102   vpc 102 [/code] Continue with FEX 102 on SWITCH 2: [code] interface Ethernet1/3   description FEX-102-PORT-2   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface Ethernet1/4   description FEX-102-PORT-4   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102 channel-group 102 interface port-channel102   switchport mode fex-fabric   fex associate 102   vpc 102 [/code] So we have just setup two dual-homed FEXes on the 5672UP switches, here is where we can kick it up a notch to set up enhanced vPC. If I had a host that plugged into FEX 101 and FEX 102 and I wanted to set up etherchannel so that host could send traffic on out both links I would put the following configuration on &lt;strong&gt;BOTH&lt;/strong&gt; switches: [code] interface eth101/1/1, eth101/1/2 channel-group 2 mode active interface eth102/1/1, eth102/1/2 channel-group 2 mode active interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 [/code] Here is the result, this is now an enhanced vPC. Some key points of this setup is be consistent with your configuration, it all has to match on both switches otherwise expect problems to arise. Enhanced vPC offers some high level redundancy, by just looking at the picture below you could have multiple failures and servers and applications would still be accessible. This makes this type of setup a common practice if business needs demand it. So I&#39;ll stop it there like before I hope this information is helpful as a reference.

&lt;p&gt;What about using the QSFP ports instead of the Ethernet1/31 and Ethernet1/32 to connect both switches together using vPC, would that also work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey John, Yes I would think that would work. However I don&#39;t know if I would use the QSFP ports for a vPC link. Those type of ports would be better for uplinks. I don&#39;t think you would be running that much traffic thorough a vPC link unless something is wrong. From what I looked at it seemed like you would want to balance it out. So for example if I had an uplink on 5k-1 to Core-1, I would also want an uplink on 5k-2 going to Core-1. That way the traffic does not need to go through the vPC unless there is a problem. Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, I found your post really helpful. I am in the process of implementing eVPC on 5672 UP. I have few questions with respect to the same, 1.You had mentioned that the host/server that connects to these different Fexes must support Active/Active NICs, does it mean that the host or server should support LACP? What if my host doesn&#39;t support LACP? 2.Can I dual home a VMware ESXi (active-active NICs on route based originating virtual port ID load balancing policy) to the fexes? … 3.Can I configure the fex port channel to static ( mode on) instead of active or lacp ? interface eth101/1/1, eth101/1/2 channel-group 2 mode on interface eth102/1/1, eth102/1/2 channel-group 2 mode on interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 Thanks in advance, Nishant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Kerry, Yes you would be able to add 4 ports in a port-channel to the FEXes. You could almost do the same thing with two 5600s without the FEXes if you wanted. Just setup a VPC and port-channel on both 5600s instead of using the FEXes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for this write up, great information. In my setup the host has 2 10g NICS for a total of 4 uplinks. Would I be able to follow your example here for PO2 but add in all 4 ports? (Ex 101/1/1-4 and 102/1/1-4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Nishant, You don&#39;t have to have Active/Active on the FEXs, you can have a single uplink from a host to a FEX and treat it like a standard port. The example that I showed is something you could do if you had a host that supported LACP. I also believe you can turn off LACP if you needed to and manually put up a port-channel on the FEX. Here is some more info: (Figure 6-5) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/mkt&#34;&gt;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/mkt&lt;/a&gt;_ops_guides/513_n1_1/n5k_enhanced_vpc.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this setup really need 8 network connections between the two nexus 5k and the two nexus 2k? Would it also work with only 4 network connections instead? and in that case would it still be called &amp;quot;dual homed&amp;quot;? I am not sure to understand the advantage of 8 network connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey John, You could use 4 connections instead of 8 you just loose the amount of bandwidth available instead of 40Gbps you would have 20Gbps that is available to the 2ks. It would also still be called a dual homed setup because that 2k switch is connected two different 5k switches. Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan, I was wondering when connecting your server redundatly on Po2 shouldn&#39;t you specify a VPC? For instance you have: interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 but as far as I understand shouldn&#39;t it be assigned a VPC, for example: interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 vpc 2 ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are correct if you would have connected the server directly to the 5ks you have to specify a VPC or if you had a single FEX connected to the 5k. In this example however I&#39;m using FEXes which already have a VPC configured from both 5ks and I&#39;m using port-channels off of those FEXes this is called &amp;quot;Enhanced vPC&amp;quot;. There is a difference between them, when you create an Enhanced vPC you don&#39;t specify a VPC on the FEXes because there is already a vPC created upstream. Regular vPC with FEXes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/configuration_guide_c07-543563.html&#34;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt; Enhanced vPC with FEXes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/layer2/513_n1_1/b_Cisco_n5k_layer2_config_gd_rel_513_N1_1/b_Cisco_n5k_layer2_config_gd_rel_513_N1_1_chapter_01010.html&#34;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt; Hope that Helps, Ryan&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg?w=118&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We are at the last chapters of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265/&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center 640-911 by Todd Lammle&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 12 talks about redundant switched technologies and chapter 13 talks about security. Just like before I will go over the high-points, so let’s get started! &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 12 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: In this chapter we get to learn about Spanning Tree Protocol and some history with it. With networks we like multiple ways to a destination however in the layer two area redundancy does not play well and that’s where spanning tree can help us. So know what spanning tree and its purpose. Spanning tree has several terms that are important to remember for the exam, I would look over page 387. For the exam know some show commands for spanning tree, like &lt;strong&gt;show spanning-tree&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;show spanning-tree summary&lt;/strong&gt;. This chapter also talked about the different types of spanning-tree but could not tell if this would be on 640-911 exam as well as port-channels which helps eliminate blocked STP ports. :) &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 13 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: In the last chapter of 640-911 book we get introduced to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/07/access-control-lists/&#34; title=&#34;Access Control Lists&#34;&gt;access-control-lists&lt;/a&gt; and the types of access-lists that the NX-OS supports, know the difference as well as configuring a standard access list and extended access list also be sure to understand the implicit deny statement at end of every access-list. I would also know how wildcard masking works, (flip the subnet mask). A couple more things I thought would be important to keep an eye out is understand that once an access-list is created that does not mean its active, make you sure to understand how to apply the ACL on an interface. Finally know your show commands for access-lists, like &lt;strong&gt;show access-list&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;show access-list summary&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Overall thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: So thanks for checking out these posts about the 640-911 exam, I hope this give you an idea of what to expect on the exam and good luck, if you decide to take it. Personally I am shooting for May/June timeframe to pass at least the 640-911. I thought this book was helpful but if you went and passed the CCNA or even CCNP it does get a little dry in areas. This exam is introductory but required if you wanted to achieve the CCNA Data Center certification. Remember you need to pass two exams 640-911 and the 640-916 to become CCNA Data Center certified. Check out all the 640-911 exam topics: &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911_dcicn.pdf&#34;&gt;640-911 Exam Topics&lt;/a&gt; A little off topic but interesting to note is as of this writing Todd Lammle is the only author that has published a study guide for the CCNA Data Center, a quick check on Amazon shows that Cisco Press is ready to roll out an official certification guide for the 640-911 in the end of August authored by a Wendell Odom, followed by the 640-916 in January of 2015. I’ll end it here, I hope this information is helpful and comment below if you have any questions on these chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

Feel free to comment below if you have any questions on either of these two chapters. &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 10 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Chapter 10 starts us back in the book, before we do any configuring and we learn about routing protocols, and remember the difference between static and dynamic routing (name implies it) Also know the default administrate distances of the different routing protocols (starts on page 297). We also got a crash course in distance vector, link-state and hybrid routing protocols. Out of RIP, RIPv2, EIGRP and OSPF where does each protocol belong? Know the differences between RIP and RIPv2 (there is a couple of them) Know what EIGRP does and it available features it offers as well as OSPF. &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: This chapter went over the dynamic routing protocols and at a fundamental level but in important one to remember not to just pass the exam but to also go further. There was a lot of good information in Chapter 10 about dynamic protocols. If you have never used/learned about dynamic routing protocols make sure you understand the chapter and go over the review questions. &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 11 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Chapter 11 looks at layer two switching technologies, we get to learn about frame tagging or also called VLANs, make sure you understand how 802.1Q works. We also looked into some configuration options like learning how to set up a trunk link, VTP options and SVIs. Know what the type of modes VTP offers, and what is required when setting up VTP what needs to match? With SVIs know how to enable them and what they are used for because it’s not just a management port. (Hint: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/01/31/configure-router-on-a-stick/&#34; title=&#34;Configure Router on a Stick&#34;&gt;Router on a Stick&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: We went from Layer 3 in the OSI back to Layer 2, we need to know the difference between VLANs as we start to blur the lines when using Router on a Stick configurations. This chapter covered the basics of VLANs an important step to make sure you understand the fundamentals. Same things goes with this chapter, if you have never used/learned about VLANs, VTP, SVIs make sure to go over the chapter and review questions. Short and sweet, please post any questions if you have any about this chapter, I hope this information is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

Comment below if you have any questions on these two chapters let&#39;s get started. &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 8 Overview:&lt;/strong&gt; We are actually making some progress, we configure the NX-OS with CLI there is not a GUI that I am aware of although SDN could be kind of in there but for this exam it does not even exist. Remember the ways to connect to the NX-OS for configuration and verification this is the same with IOS devices, Console, Telnet, SSH and Auxiliary. Just like IOS we can erase the entire NX-OS switch to factory settings by using the write erase boot, along with using the same commands available in IOS. (Copy run start, erase start config) In the exam we need to understand and add SVIs, remember to turn on that feature. The NX-OS brings two user roles out of the box without implementing any access-control when logging into the NX-OS you can have network-operators and network-admins, know the difference between these two. Just like IOS learn how to use the help functions available in the NX-OS along with knowing how to create a hostname and finally the know the advantages of using SSH and the requirements to set up SSH. &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: This chapter went over how to get started in configuring and setting up the Nexus. It reminded me of on old post I did for IOS about &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/01/26/basic-router-configuration/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Router Configuration&#34;&gt;Basic Router Configuration&lt;/a&gt;. This chapter just got you close enough to touch the hardware and turn it on but not really run it. &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 9 Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;  Changing some gears in this chapter we learn about IP Routing we get a crash course in this. This chapters talks about the IP Routing process. How does the packet get from point A get to point B. Look over page 278 carefully to make sure you understand it also be sure to understand the role of the MAC address. I also thought it was interesting of how the routing table looks in NX-OS when comparing it to IOS devices on page 277, I would also study this. &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: Chapter 9 had some key areas for the IP routing if you are familiar with the CCNA this would be a good refresh course, chapter 10 will get us familiar with routing protocols. Like always I hope this is helpful, comment below if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg?w=118&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you made it past the earlier chapters this one should be interesting, like before I am going through each chapter of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265/&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle&lt;/a&gt;. Comment below if you have questions in this chapter, last week we learned about subnetting and in this chapter we will learn about the NX-OS which is Cisco&#39;s Data Center switches. Let&#39;s begin! &lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: This was short chapter in introducing the NX-OS product line and into the virtualized enviroments that data centers are now becoming. In this chapter you will discover that Cisco wants all traffic both SAN and LAN unified on one switch instead of being separate devices. The NX-OS is a Linux system with some pretty neat isolation features with the data and control plane separated and the ability to offload crunching to dedicated CPUs instead of sharing the load. I also liked how the system manger worked, it reminds me of a watchdog making sure everything is running in par and the ability to restart processes with automatic restart thanks to PSS. (Persistent Storage Service) Being able to upgrade the software and still being able to forwarded traffic is also very cool, thanks ISSU (No downtime around here :) ) I hinted on an &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2013/12/01/connecting-fex-5k-to-2k/&#34; title=&#34;Connecting FEX (5k to 2k)&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; that the Nexus runs on efficiency and only loads what it needs or configured, why load up NTP if you are not going to use it? Know some common process that can run on the NX-OS like STP, CDP, and HSRP. All of these have to be turned on before you can use them. Some other cool things you can do is VRF which separates the routing table for multi-tenancy or for security requirements. Finally being able to a VDC (virtualized dedicated device) which is able run another copy of the NX-OS on the same hardware and depending the model of Nexus hardware you are using you can run up to eight different systems! **My thoughts: **Very cool stuff going on in the Cisco world, if you never heard of the Nexus and this is first time reading this chapter what does this remind you of? We know that servers took a huge movement into virtualization to combat server sprawl. The Nexus is attempting a similar approach to add to their portfolio. What is interesting to me is the Nexus was first introduced in the beginning of 2008, which makes the NX-OS product six years old. For the exam go over the chapter and review questions as always ask questions if you have any by commenting below.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg?w=118&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let&#39;s start chapter six of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265/&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle&lt;/a&gt;, feel free to post questions if you have any. Like before I have covered the topics of the each chapter. Last week we learned about the different IP classes and today we get a course in subnetting. Let&#39;s go over what you should know if you want to pass the exam. **Overview: **It seems I have talked subnetting to death on this blog, repetition, repetition, repetition. So known the advantages of subnetting why would you use it along with knowing what IP subnet zero is. You also should be able to take a classful network and break it into smaller networks some math is involved but it&#39;s not rocket science, if you get lost go over it again you&#39;ll start seeing pattern when subnetting. Since we are subnetting, know the purpose of the subnet mask that&#39;s associated with the IP address. Also be sure you can explain what CIDR is and the difference between a classful network. &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have been around with subnetting you can probably glance over this chapter but I would go over the labs that start on page 190. There is also some more information about subnetting on this blog you can find &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/04/01/part-1-the-joys-of-subnetting/&#34; title=&#34;Part 1 – The Joys of Subnetting!&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/04/23/part-2-the-joys-of-subnetttting-vlsm/&#34; title=&#34;Part 2 – The Joys of Subnetttting – VLSM!&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;. Also another good site for sharping subneting skills is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.subnettingquestions.com/&#34;&gt;subnettingquestions.com &lt;/a&gt;. Believe it or not we have finished the back story to finally get to what we want to know which is Cisco&#39;s data center switches the NX-OS product line. I have mention this before at the start of the series, if you know the material have a CCNA or just been around routing and switching you could have glanced over these earlier chapters. This exam starts at the beginning and if you want to move into CCNP you must have passed the 640-911 and the 940-916. Let&#39;s continue to see what the 640-911 exam topics have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

Like before feel free to post questions below. In these post I am only going over the topics of each chapter of the book, plus any examples the book offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover. In chapter three we discussed about Ethernet Technologies and in chapter four we will learn about the TCP/IP protocol which is fundamentally the protocol that makes the Internet work. &lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: The chapter started talking about the DoD model and comparing it to the OSI model, remember this and a little history behind it as well as the layers the DoD model shows its relevance with the OSI model. We start talking about applications like Telnet, FTP, SMTP what are these? Know the common applications and their port numbers. The chapter also talked about host-to-host layer protocols like TCP and UDP, know the difference between these two, and some memorization of what the TCP and UDP header looks like. (Which one is unreliable and which one uses acknowledgments and flow control?) We also looked into the Internet layer Protocols, do you know them all and their functions? Also know what the IP header looks like. (What does it include?) &lt;strong&gt;Personal Story&lt;/strong&gt;: I wanted to jump in and talk about my personal experience with TCP/IP protocol mainly the ICMP management of it. I was contracted with a company that had a Cisco Phone System and a 2900 router using SiP as well as Internet on top it. They had this time clock system that would send punches over a VPN to a corporate office and it was setup and working for a while until of course it eventually stopped sending time punches. This took about a week to figure out as the VPN was online and you could contact the device from corporate. With a SPAN port I could see traffic hitting the time clock as well as it coming back. The issue was when the 2900 router was setup, it was set to disregard ICMP (For general network security) because of the way the time clock is designed it would use ICMP to decide the acceptable MTU size before sending time punches. Since it never got a reply it would fail on sending time punches, in the end I enabled the router to accept ICMP to fix the issue. Long story short, ICMP is a management protocol for IP and although it can be used against you, it&#39;s a balancing act between security and functionally and in this case the time clock used ICMP legitimately, lesson learned. :) &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; Personally I liked going over this chapter it starts to put some pieces together, I would read it over if you have seen this before just lock down any missing parts. Also post any questions about this chapter below. Could be Helpful? &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911_dcicn.pdf&#34;&gt;640-911 Exam Topics&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/25/understanding-tcp/&#34; title=&#34;Understanding TCP&#34;&gt;Understanding TCP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/28/understanding-udp/&#34; title=&#34;Understanding UDP&#34;&gt;Understanding UDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CCNP Security Refresh</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2014/02/03/ccnp-security-refresh/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 14:30:27 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2014/02/03/ccnp-security-refresh/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Cisco recently published its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html&#34;&gt;2014 Annual Security Report&lt;/a&gt;, and some interesting data was captured in 2013. One of the details was a talent gap in network security and because of this gap Cisco has a major revision in the CCNP Security certification starting in April. Its estimated that in short term or already present is shortage of more than a million security professionals worldwide! Like mentioned because of this Cisco is reworking the CCNP Security track. Let&#39;s get into the details of the changes coming in April 22nd 2014. One thing I noticed is the exam names themselves such as the old exams are specifying Cisco&#39;s own technologies to solve these security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;642-637 (SECURE) Securing Networks with Cisco Routers and Switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;642-618 (FIREWALL) Deploying Cisco ASA Firewall Solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;642-648 (VPN) Deploying Cisco ASA VPN Solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;642-627 (IPS) Implementing Cisco Intrusion Prevention System.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refreshed exam looks at the overall picture of security instead of throwing in a specific box to solve your problem along with knowing how to administrate the device. The new exam names are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300-208 (SISAS) Implementing Cisco Secure Access Solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300-206 (SENSS) Implementing Cisco Edge Network Security Solutions .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300-209 (SIMOS) Implementing Cisco Secure Mobility Solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300-207 (SITCS) Implementing Cisco Threat Control Solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alignment goes together with the new material of the Associate level exam (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2013/09/30/ccna-2-0-whats-new/&#34; title=&#34;CCNA 2.0 What’s New?&#34;&gt;CCNA 2.0&lt;/a&gt; Is what I&#39;m calling it :) ) What is also interesting is Cisco is retiring alot of the Security Specialist exams on April 22nd 2014, below is a list of exams and their last day to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco ASA Specialist  - April 21st 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco Firewall Security Specialist - April 21st 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco IOS Security Specialist - April 21st 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco IPS Security Specialist - April 21st 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco Network Admission Control Specialist - April 21st 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco VPN Security Specialist - Aprial 21st 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return Cisco is offering training for these specific products, I was unable to tell if completing these training courses tied to any new certifications. My guess is since Cisco is retiring these types of specialist certifications, these are just training materials to help you better understand Cisco&#39;s product line along with administrating the product. All of this is still pretty new information, the Cisco Learning Network will be having CCNP Tech Seminars stating February 4th and going through April 1st. All of this free to access by registering which would be incredibility helpful. &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccnpsecurity/senss/ccnp_security_tech_seminars&#34; title=&#34;CCNP Security Tech Seminars&#34;&gt;CCNP Security Tech Seminars&lt;/a&gt; Like always I hope the above information is helpful. If you have any questions or if you currently studying for the CCNP Security comment below on what you think about these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

In these post I am only going over the topics of each chapter of the book, plus any examples the book offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover. In chapter two we discussed about internetworking and in chapter three we will learn about Ethernet technologies. **Overview: **Chapter 3 goes over what chapter 2 started we get more information on collision domains, broadcast domains, and introductions into CSMA/CD and the familiarity link between half and full-duplex ethernet. We also looked at the sections of a MAC address and what the IEEE is involved with assignment of these address when giving them to manufactures. We learned about how to convert binary to hexadecimal as well as vice versa. We also looked at the Data link layer and the fields associated with it.(Which part of the OSI model is that?) Chapter 2 hinted on the cabling standards but we now have a list full of them starting from coaxial cable to single-mode fiber cable. (Which goes further?) We also learned which  type of cable connects to what and how they are terminated. (Like devices use a crossover cable and not a straight-through cable) We finally talked about Data encapsulation and had some good examples at the end of the chapter of how a computer sends information on the network and it looks like more information is in Chapter 9 :) . &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; I would read this chapter even if you went through it before there is a lot of information that needs refreshed (at least for me) if you are going to take the exam. Go over the review questions and over the written labs for converting from decimal to binary and from binary to hexadecimal. Could be helpful?: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/10/crossover-or-straight-through/&#34; title=&#34;Crossover or Straight through?&#34;&gt;Crossover or Straight through?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911_dcicn.pdf&#34;&gt;640-911 Exam Topics&lt;/a&gt;(PDF)&lt;/p&gt;

I figured that this type of post would help me and anybody else looking at studying for the exam. Feel free to post questions below as if  on a study group, In these post I am only going over the topics of each chapter of the book, plus any examples the book offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover. Continuing where we left off from &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2014/01/16/640-911-chapter-1/&#34; title=&#34;640-911 (Chapter 1)&#34;&gt;chapter one&lt;/a&gt; let’s begin chapter 2. &lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt; Chapter 2 goes over the difference between a broadcast domains and collision domains and how to find them. What does the &amp;quot;Router&amp;quot; do for us when using it in a LAN? What are the advantages of it and the functions it offers? We also were introduced into the OSI model. What is it and what are the advantages of it? Todd also went over each layer of the model with more detail on the Transport layer, Network layer and the Data Link layer. For example in the Transport layer we learned about the TCP and UDP and the difference between those two protocols. Along with understanding TCP&#39;s connection-oriented process, the three-way handshake.  We also looked other features that TCP offers like what does flow control do for us? Along with understanding what windowing and acknowledgments are. Going from layer 4 to layer 3 we were introduced into the network addresses and what they do along with knowing some terminology like routing tables, interfaces, and metrics.  Going down from layer 3 to layer 2 what is a frame vs. a packet and what is the difference between the Media Access Control (802.3) and the Logical Link Control (802.2) Finally at layer 1 this chapter talked a bit about the cabling standards but it lets you know why hubs are a layer 1 device and the difference between switch and a hub. &lt;strong&gt;My thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: This chapter goes over a lot of material that was somewhat introduced in chapter one but goes further into details. I would study the OSI model and its different layers if you have never used it before. Like on chapter one I would go over the review questions starting on page 54 before skipping this chapter. Like before if you have questions on chapter two comment below and the check back next week for chapter three! I have posted before on this blog some items that would go along with this chapter:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640-911-todd-lammle.jpg?w=118&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So I bought the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1389461666&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=ccna+data+center&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Data Center - Introducing Cisco Data Center Networking Study Guide: Exam 640-911&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle&lt;/a&gt;. I have decided it would be a good idea to go over the topics of each chapter of this book in series of  blog posts. The idea of this is to work together if on a study group, go over the topics in each chapter of the book, talk about examples and to get an idea of what the exam would cover. Below are my thoughts about chapter one. &lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt; So when I read chapter one I had to remind myself this is an introduction into the CCNA Data Center exam, as I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/11/21/ccna-data-center/&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Data Center&#34;&gt;talked before&lt;/a&gt; the 640-911 exam has no perquisites so we started at the beginning. Asking ourselves “What is a Network?” Todd does a good job in introducing us into these technologies, like understanding what a LAN, WAN is and the difference between these types of logical topologies. We also covered the most common types of network devices such as a workstations, servers, and printers and what function they do on the network. As well as understanding what a peer-to-peer network is and client/server network, when would you use these type of network architectures? We then finally jumped into the type of physical topologies like what a bus, star, ring, are and what are the pros and cons of each? At the end of this chapter you should understand the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the types of network topologies. For example what is the difference between a logical topology and a physical topology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the pros and cons of each topology. For example a Mesh topology vs. a Star topology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the difference between a LANs and WANs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-thoughts-for-this-chapter-its-a-review-if-you-went-over-some-ccentccna-study-materials-or-have-a-ccent-however-dont-skip-over-this-chapter-instead-i-would-check-the-review-questions-on-page-23-if-you-do-pretty-well-go-over-to-chapter-two-i-have-of-hinted-on-this-before-if-you-have-a-ccna-or-higher-it-may-seem-like-a-review-but-there-are-flakes-of-new-material-scattered-into-the-exam-and-just-enough-to-fail-you-if-you-decide-to-skip-it--i-hope-this-information-will-be-helpful-and-if-you-have-any-questions-on-chapter-one-comment-below&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; For this chapter it&#39;s a review if you went over some CCENT/CCNA study materials or have a CCENT, however don’t skip over this chapter. Instead I would check the review questions on page 23, if you do pretty well go over to chapter two. I have of hinted on this before if you have a CCNA or higher it may seem like a review but there are flakes of new material scattered into the exam and just enough to fail you if you decide to skip it. :) I hope this information will be helpful and if you have any questions on chapter one comment below.&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>GNS3 1.0 Campaign</title>

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/logo_gns3_small.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/logo_gns3_small.png&#34; alt=&#34;GNS3-logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It&#39;s been almost 24 hours since GNS3 launched a campaign to bring in funds to support the open source network simulator and bring it up to version 1.0. A lot of new features are on the list, like switching, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing&#34; title=&#34;Cloud computing&#34;&gt;cloud processing&lt;/a&gt;, hassle free configuration, labs/training materials and 3rd party integrations. All of which are in the works for this new version added along with some pretty cool plug-ins. As of writing this post they are at $106,973 dollars which is 300 percent over funded! A pretty good turnout in fact they meet their goal in less than 4 hours of stating the campaign and have 16 days left to go. GNS3 has had a history of being one of those free products that can be little overwhelming at first. However once you start looking into blogs, videos and other many helpful resources about GNS3 it becomes an amazing tool to simulate networks. In fact once you have verified/tested your configuration you could take that same running-config from GNS3 and paste into production, what free network simulation product does that? I have used GNS3 for the most part for studying &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;Cisco certifications&lt;/a&gt; but just recently I have found that GNS3 to be very helpful in my current work environment as I am able to play around with network designs. I could also think of other ways to use GNS3 like for demo networks, poof-of-concept ideas, security projects and much more. From what I can tell from the ideas and features coming into version 1.0 I am hopeful that this version will be a game changer for GNS3 just as it was six years ago. If you have used GNS3 before go ahead and take a look at their &lt;a href=&#34;https://gns3.crowdhoster.com/become-an-early-release-member&#34;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; and see if you would like to contribute, or you can as always wait until it officially releases for free. If you never used GNS3 but have an interest go ahead and download the latest version of it, there is some good &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gns3.net/documentation/&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; on GNS3’s website on how to configure it as well other blogs and videos of how to install/configure. I hope this short post is informative and just for a FYI I’ve personally contributed to the GNS3 campaign. Good Luck Stephen and Jeremy! So with that what would you like to see in GNS3 1.0, and in future versions of the product? Also what has the current version of GNS3 helped you with? Comment Below! More Information: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gns3.net/early-release-faq/&#34; title=&#34;Early Release FAQ&#34;&gt;General GNS3 Early Release FAQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://gns3.crowdhoster.com/become-an-early-release-member&#34;&gt;CrowdFunding Page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gns3.net/&#34;&gt;GNS3 Homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CCNA 2-0 What&#39;s New?</title>

      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2013/09/30/ccna-2-0-whats-new/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/exploration.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/exploration.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cisco-Network&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I brought this topic up in March of this year &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2013/03/26/ccna-version-2-0-refresh/&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Version 2.0 Refresh&#34;&gt;(See original post)&lt;/a&gt; but I wanted to re-post it to add some information because as of today this was your last day to pass the older &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNA&#34; title=&#34;CCNA&#34;&gt;CCNA&lt;/a&gt; exams. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; has a refreshed all the CCNA Routing and Switching exams. That includes the ICND1 (640-822), the ICND2 (640-816), and the all in wonder exam (640-816). You will notice some old references no longer mentioned on this refresh, so let&#39;s go over the differences and some of the changes Cisco has made to the associate-level certification track. Starting at the CCNA the refreshed exams are the following, 100-101 ICND1 &lt;strong&gt;(which replaces 640-822 exam)&lt;/strong&gt;, 200-101 ICND2 &lt;strong&gt;(which replaces 640-816 exam)&lt;/strong&gt;, and the all in wonder 200-120 CCNA &lt;strong&gt;(which replaces the all in wonder 640-802 exam)&lt;/strong&gt;. Like I mentioned earlier the last day to take these older exams are September 30th of 2013 so good luck :) What has changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The certification was formerly called CCNA  is now called CCNA Routing and Switching with no prerequisites (Like before)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you wish to have advanced technology certifications like the CCNA Security, CCNA Voice, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;CCNA Wireless&lt;/a&gt; you must have at least a CCENT or CCNA R&amp;amp;S &lt;strong&gt;(Before you had to have CCNA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect these exams to have Router IOS version 15 instead of versions 12.4, expect more IPv6 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information&#34; title=&#34;Information&#34;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; as IPv4 is depleted , and IOS licensing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Routing Information Protocol&#34;&gt;RIP&lt;/a&gt; version 1 or version 2 :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Wireless LAN&#34;&gt;WLAN&lt;/a&gt; information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the information that was in the ICND2 has shifted to the new ICND1 100-101.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also check out this MircoNugget with Jeremy Cioara to see some other detail about the new exams: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym3zBF4-2J0&#34;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym3zBF4-2J0&lt;/a&gt; You can find more information at &lt;a href=&#34;http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;amp;articleId=1156334http://&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Evolves Associate-Level Certifications, Redesigns CCNA Routing and Switching Certification to Support Next-Generation Job Roles&#34;&gt;Cisco&#39;s Newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, along with going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/index.html&#34; title=&#34;Training &amp;amp; Certifications&#34;&gt;Cisco&#39;s Training &amp;amp; Certifications site&lt;/a&gt; and looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/associate/index.html&#34; title=&#34;Associate Certifications&#34;&gt;Associate Certifications area&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Why Go Professional with Cisco Certs?</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2013/09/14/why-go-professional-with-cisco-certs/</link>

      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2013/09/14/why-go-professional-with-cisco-certs/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;I have had the opportunity to take and thankfully pass &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;Cisco certifications&lt;/a&gt; at the associate levels and there is one more associate exam, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNA&#34; title=&#34;CCNA&#34;&gt;CCNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center&#34; title=&#34;Data center&#34;&gt;Data Center&lt;/a&gt; which hopefully I will get later next year.  While looking at the CCNA Data Center exam I also glanced over the professional arena that Cisco offers and if you’re like me I always like learning new things especially in technical field. Getting those “aha moments” once in a while makes it worth it, but beyond just over all knowledge of additional technologies why would you go on taking a professional Cisco cert? I find these type of questions all over web, “Is CCNP worth it?” My answer is it depends on your current job situation. Let’s say you are in dead-end entry-level technical position, you’ve been there for a couple of years and for the most part your job hasn’t change. Would getting a CCNP automatically move you up those ranks? Probably not. You also have to look at the company you’re working for, is this just an average company, and all that is needed is a technical person or team depending on the size to support the environment? Would getting a CCNP be worth it, are you actually going to be using that knowledge you learned to better help the company? Or would that be wasted time and money? Let’s say you don’t have your foot in the door and you are right out of college or even high school would getting a CCNP get you noticed? Absolutely however I would not recommend getting a CCNP and then looking for a job. Start out with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompTIA&#34; title=&#34;CompTIA&#34;&gt;Network+&lt;/a&gt; or CCENT get an entry-level position and start getting that experience that employers often look for. I know its easier said than done but for both of these situations and in my opinion if you can longer move up the ladder or the company is not focused or in need of CCNP knowledge, find a company that is before you start studying in the professional arena. I also think it depends on where you live physically are there actual companies in your area that are in need of CCNP candidates? Or would you have to move, and most importantly do you want to move? Unfortunately these are all questions that I would need answered before I would even start looking in the professional arena personally. Not to say CCNP is not rewarding, there usually is higher pay, and these professional certs have a proven track record in career advancements, gaining additional knowledge and finally staying up to date with current network technologies. You may even find yourself being contacted by company recruiters if your name is out there. In my opinion any body that passes any Cisco Certification has definitely made themselves noticeable but there has to be balance. Where do I stand? I think eventually I&#39;ll get there, but with my current position I&#39;m pretty happy where I am. :) When putting this post together I was also reading a published a white paper that Cisco put out recently looking at the value of Cisco Certified Employees take a look at the linked PDF and like always I hope this information is helpful, comment below of what you think about of professional certs? Do you have any, have they helped out and are they worth it? &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/cisco_employervalue.pdf&#34;&gt;What Is the Value of a Cisco Certified Employee?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Passed 640-554!</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2013/06/29/passed-640-554/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Short story, I am proud to say that I passed! I have studied off and on in the beginning of the year but I did set a date to take the exam which was June 28th .As that date was getting closer I buckled down and reviewed the materials again and focused in on some areas that I knew I was weak in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how was the 640-554 exam, what did I use to pass the exam and what exam am I focusing on next?  The 640-554 exam that I took surprised me which left me at the edge of the seat the entire testing period! 8-O There where lot of difficult questions that I would have missed if I hadn’t of re-reviewed the study materials, along with the amount of questions I had to go through to meet the 90 minute deadline, but it was worth it! After I saw my passing score on screen it definitely was a fair score that I received. I did not feel cheated or have any questions that weren’t on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/exams/list/iins.html#~Topics&#34; title=&#34;640-554 IINS&#34;&gt;exam topic list&lt;/a&gt;, so I was overall pleased with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to question that is often asked, what materials did I use to pass the exam?  I used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Security-640-554-Official-Guide/dp/1587204460/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1372552672&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=ccna+security+640-554+official+cert+guide&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Security 640-554 Official Cert Guide &#34;&gt;CCNA Security 640-554 Official Cert Guide&lt;/a&gt; authored by Keith Barker and Scott Morris which is an excellent study guide. I also used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.cbtnuggets.com/it-training-videos/series/csco_640_554&#34; title=&#34;Cisco CCNA Security 640-554 - Implementing Cisco IOS Network Security (IINS)&#34;&gt;CBT Nugget Series Cisco CCNA Security 640-554&lt;/a&gt; which is also by Keith Barker to at first learn about the material, take some notes on it and then review it in the cert guide by going through the chapters, reviewing the questions that are in the beginning of the chapters, along with using the study material that was included in the book. I also had some lab gear that was helpful in either following along with the CBT videos or just building some test labs. The lab I have follows the one I posted back in September (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/09/07/cisco-lab-setup/&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Lab Setup&#34;&gt;Cisco Lab Setup&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recently was able to get two more 2960 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Catalyst&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Catalyst&#34;&gt;Cisco Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; switches. :) So what is my next plan? Not sure I might look at that new &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2012/11/21/ccna-data-center/&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Data Center&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center&lt;/a&gt; exam which was announced last fall and it also looked like they may have some study material for it, at least for first exam (640-911 DCICN). I might start on the CCNP journey but either way I am still planning on posting on this blog with tutorials, ideas and other stories. I am also happy that I was able to make some changes of the layout and color of this blog, I hope you enjoy the new look and like always I hope this information is helpful and enjoy your summer!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction into Cisco Configuration Professional</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2013/03/10/introduction-into-cisco-configuration-professional/</link>

      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2013/03/10/introduction-into-cisco-configuration-professional/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s walk through the basics with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; Configuration Professional as it is a helpful tool to use at the associate levels of the Cisco certification track and needed if you are looking at getting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;CCNA Security&lt;/a&gt; certification. In this introduction we will introduce CCP and setup a community and then finally discover our devices within CCP. This is not the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&#34; title=&#34;Graphical user interface&#34;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; tool Cisco has produced to manage individual routers, an older tool called Cisco SDM also helped Network Administrators which supports the ISR Generation 1 routers. In this blog a while back I talked about Cisco SDM and walked through &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/tag/cisco-sdm/&#34; title=&#34;Tag Cisco SDM&#34;&gt;some tutorials on using it&lt;/a&gt;. Although it&#39;s reaching age with Cisco support it is still officially supported until February 28th 2014. The good news with CCP is it supports these older ISR Generation 1 routers as well as the new ISR Generation 2 routers, were Cisco SDM only support ISR G1 routers. In this tutorial I am using CCP version 2.6 and to get your hands on CCP all you need is a login into Cisco (which is free), your account does not need to have any current support contracts tied to it, just be sure to download the 160MB file and install it on a PC that has access to the supported Cisco routers. The system requirements to run CCP is to have Java installed and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player&#34; title=&#34;Adobe Flash Player&#34;&gt;Adobe Flash player&lt;/a&gt; along with at least 1GB of RAM (it won&#39;t let you install it if you have less). NOTE: I have had the hardest time getting this working on Windows 7 with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&#34; title=&#34;Internet Explorer&#34;&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; 9 so I bailed and went to running &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&#34; title=&#34;Windows XP&#34;&gt;Windows XP SP3&lt;/a&gt; with Internet Explorer 8. Let me know if you can get it working with Windows 7, according to Cisco it&#39;s supported, here the Release Notes for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_configuration_professional/v2_6/rlsnts/ccp_rel_notes.html&#34; title=&#34;Release Notes for Cisco Configuration Professional 2.6&#34;&gt;Cisco Configuration Professional 2.6&lt;/a&gt; to prove it. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Thanks to Kevin and his suggestion I was able to get CCP working with Windows 7 and Windows Vista using Internet Explorer 9. In either Windows 7 and Windows Vista, Right-Click on the CCP icon and select Run as Administrator&lt;/strong&gt; (An easy fix) :) After CCP is installed you&#39;ll need a router, or if you just want to see what it looks like you can demo this program. When you demo this program not all features will be enabled, but it does get you familiar with the CCP interface. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-demo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-demo.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-Demo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When you first open CCP you will be presented a screen to manage your community. A community is a group of routers that may or may not share something in common. This could be that all routers in community called group A are physically at building A, or you could use the hierarchical model and have a community for all core routers but then a separate community for all branch routers. Or you could have all of your routers in one community in the end the design of how to organize it is up to you. A CCP Community can have up to ten routers in one community, so if you have more ten routers you will have to use at least two different communities. In this example you can see I have three routers all in one community called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation&#34; title=&#34;Acme Corporation&#34;&gt;Acme Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. If you noticed on the Manage Community page there is an option to connect securely, this is recommend if this is in a production environment as it protects the username and password with SSH and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure&#34; title=&#34;HTTP Secure&#34;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;. In this example I selected the check box Discover all devices which is towards the bottom of the Manage Community page, CCP would attempt to login into each router with the username and password I provided and read its current running-configuration. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-community.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-community.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-Community&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You could also discover each device manually if you did not want to discover all routers in the community by just selecting the router&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; and choosing the option Discover. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-discover.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ccp-discover.png?w=584&#34; alt=&#34;CCP-Discover&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I would say that&#39;s a good introduction into CCP. I would go ahead and download the program and get comfortable with it. Because it is an area the CCNA Security exam is likely to test on. CCP has a lot of features to it and we only started at the basics for getting the program running and discovering our devices. Check back often as I would like to go through some of the wizards within CCP as well as some of the advanced functionally that is available with CCP, you don&#39;t always have to go command-line commando and I would consider CCP a good program to use for your technical toolbox. Like always I hope this information is helpful. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan, this from the cisco security lab manual: Note: If the PC is running Windows 7, it may be necessary to right-click on the Cisco CP icon or menu item, and choose Run as administrator. In order to run CCP, it may be necessary to temporarily disable antivirus programs and O/S firewalls. Make sure that all pop-up blockers are turned off in the browser. Also you need to upgrade or downgrade your java version if you are using IE...I can find out the version if you need to know or you can check the cisco forum. &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:alan777gfa@gmail.com&#34;&gt;alan777gfa@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; Good article.

&lt;p&gt;It does work on win7, but my problem is that, contrary to what you said, its not very good at working with gen1 isr&#39;s. Usually i get only partial functionality with older routers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Kevin, Good to know, I figured it was possible to work Windows 7. I just have not had any luck with it. I am curious what functionally is missing on the ISR G1s that you have seen? Most of the G1s have to have at least a 12.4(9)T IOS image on them. (At least according to Cisco) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9422/data&#34;&gt;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9422/data&lt;/a&gt;_sheet_c78_462210.html Ryan&lt;/p&gt;

Like the name suggests this exam focuses on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center&#34; title=&#34;Data center&#34;&gt;Data Center&lt;/a&gt; and if passed you can continue up the stack by also taking the CCNP Data Center exam which was also recently introduced as well. Still want more a little more, if you are up for the challenge you can also tackle the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCIE_Certification&#34; title=&#34;CCIE Certification&#34;&gt;CCIE&lt;/a&gt; Data Center which is an exam that was introduced in March of 2012.  Looking at the CCNA DC certification requirements, there is no need to get certificated in the regular CCNA &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing&#34; title=&#34;Routing&#34;&gt;Routing&lt;/a&gt; and Switching as it is not required but looking at the renewal options for this certification you have to either get a CCNA concentration exam like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;CCNA Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, Security, Voice, SP, SP Ops or a higher certification like CCNP and above. &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ccna-data-centere1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ccna-data-centere1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Cert Table&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An interesting thing I noticed when looking at Cisco&#39;s Career Certifications is that if you passed your CCNA Data Center exam and then later you passed the regular CCNA exam the CCNA Data Center certification would not renew. Unlike if you recived your CCNP Data Center certification and then took the CCNP exam it would renew you CCNP Data Center certification. What makes this exam so different from the rest of Cisco&#39;s certifications? Well to what I can tell this exam focuses on a specific area, meaning you don&#39;t need to have any certifications to back you up before you take the CCNA Data Center exam, and you can continue with CCNP Data Center exam without the need to have any other certifications beside CCNA DC. To pass the CCNA Data Center and receive your certification, you will need to pass two exams. The first exam (640-911 DCICN) looks at how a Data Center network works, along with configuring, verifying and troubleshooting data center switches. This exam also looks at implementing data center &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34; title=&#34;IP address&#34;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; schemes and configuring, along with verifying and troubleshooting routing on Nexus switches. The second exam (640-916 DCICT) looks at Cisco&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabric_computing&#34; title=&#34;Fabric computing&#34;&gt;Unified Computing&lt;/a&gt; System, and virtualization by talking about the fundamentals. Along with focusing on the data center storage switching and the unified fabric between them. Finally this exam looks at the Data Center Network Services, like such as Cisco ACS and load balancing between servers and management options. Excited? You can find more information by going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/ccna_dc/index.html&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Data Center Certification&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center - Career Certifications&lt;/a&gt; and check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna_data_center&#34;&gt;The Cisco Learning Network and the section  CCNA Data Center&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this recent announcement there are limited if any Cisco Press books out there, (Let me know if you find one ;) ) but I&#39;m sure that will change within a couple months. Check back to this post to see any updates on reading material as I will be actively looking. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a book available from Todd Lammle - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Data Center - Introducing Cisco Data Center Networking Study Guide&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center - Introducing Cisco Data Center Networking Study Guide&lt;/a&gt; This title looks like it only covers the 640-911 exam. **UPDATE 2: **Since Cisco has now re-amped the ICND1 (ICND1 100-101) and ICND2 (ICND2 200-101) you can now get the CCNA Data Center cert renewed by passing the any current Associate-level exam except for the ICND1. :)&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/network-security-lock.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/network-security-lock.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;network-security-lock&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Out with the old and in with new Cisco is updating its well-known certification &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;CCNA Security&lt;/a&gt;. Candidates that are studying for the older exam (640-553) are suggested to take it on or before September 30th 2012. What has changed in the exam? For the most part Cisco SDM is no longer covered, as it has reached its &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; and in fact Cisco Engineering stopped covering the product from developing and testing on February 26th 2012. You can still renew the product for support (Cisco SmartNet) until March 24th of 2013 and the last date the product will get support will be February 28th of 2014 after that it will become an old friend :). Let&#39;s compare these two CCNA Security Exams and see what has changed, removed and added. (640-553 &amp;amp; 640-554)  I have compared these two exams side-by-side. If you take look at these two exams, the red on the older exam means it is no longer covered on the (640-554 exam) and the blue on the new exam is new material that is not covered on the (640-553 exam). For the most part Cisco SDM is no longer available instead it is the Cisco Configuration Professional along with that the new exam mentions the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_ASA&#34; title=&#34;Cisco ASA&#34;&gt;Cisco ASA&lt;/a&gt; system and walking you into the ASDM along with the different products and services the ASA system offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part if you have older books and products that cover the 640-553 exam continue studying as you can see when you compare these exams the fundamentals stay the same and if you think you can take it before September 30th go ahead and go for it! For me I want to take the new exam so I&#39;ll take it after September 30th. I also have some good tutorials that cover SDM like (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/18/configure-cisco-sdm/&#34; title=&#34;Configure Cisco SDM&#34;&gt;Configure Cisco SDM&lt;/a&gt;) back a year ago on this blog along with some security topics like AAA an Radius and TACACS+ go ahead search for them! If you are like me and want to get your hands on some books that cover the new exam (640-554) you will have to wait until July 16th for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Security-640-554-Official-Guide/dp/1587204460/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1338222713&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Security 640-554 Official Cert Guide &#34;&gt;Official Certification Guide&lt;/a&gt; according to Amazon but you can go head and order the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Security-640-554-Portable-Command-Guide/dp/1587204487/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1338222713&amp;amp;sr=8-2&#34; title=&#34;CCNA Security (640-554) Portable Command Guide&#34;&gt;CCNA Security Portable Command Guide&lt;/a&gt; which released today.

&lt;p&gt;What do you use for labs? hardware or virtualized? if virtualized, do you use gns3 if hardware, where did you get your hardware form? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Adam, I have used both and GNS3 works for routers well, but for switches it does not support them well. For the physical gear eBay is a pretty good spot. Hope that helps&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cisco Learning Labs is Live!</title>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Yesterday was kind of exciting at least for me when I got an e-mail in the morning about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; Learning Labs. Studying for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNA&#34; title=&#34;CCNA&#34;&gt;CCNA&lt;/a&gt;, CCNP or CCIP is in itself changeling, but getting that hands-on experience is a another problem! When money is short that last thing you want to do is spend it on routers and switches, and most of them on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay&#34; title=&#34;EBay&#34;&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; are used and the risk of failing devices makes it a scary choice. The Cisco Learning Labs which started yesterday runs the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS&#34; title=&#34;Cisco IOS&#34;&gt;Cisco IOS&lt;/a&gt; software on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix&#34; title=&#34;Unix&#34;&gt;UNIX&lt;/a&gt;, this makes it a real configuration and provides people the ability to use the Cisco IOS software on their PC with an internet connection. What it the difference between simulators like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_Tracer&#34; title=&#34;Packet Tracer&#34;&gt;Packet Tracer&lt;/a&gt; and GNS3? We know that Packet Tracer does not support all the commands, but is enough for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Networking_Academy&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Networking Academy&#34;&gt;Cisco Networking Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Packet Tracer does a great job, but if you ever wanted to really explore the router or switch you will need to have access to real equipment. GNS3 does an excellent job for routers but fails on switches and takes some &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit&#34; title=&#34;Central processing unit&#34;&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt; power. You also need the real Cisco IOS and the only &amp;quot;legal&amp;quot; way to get one is from the router that you bought. Cisco Learning Labs have multiple labs that are available when you buy a lab bundle; these labs are available for 90 days and up to 25 hours whichever comes first. The timer only counts down when you actually use it by signing in. You can also buy more lab time in increments of five hours. Currently the Cisco Learning Labs support the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;Cisco Certifications&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Well my first of the many &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Career_Certifications&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Career Certifications&#34;&gt;Cisco certifications&lt;/a&gt; that I plan take in the future was a success! I was able to pass the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnecting_Cisco_Networking_Devices_Part_1&#34; title=&#34;Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 1&#34;&gt;ICND1&lt;/a&gt; exam. This blog post is going to be a little different in that I want to share how I was able to pass this test and talk about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well in January after finishing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Networking_Academy&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Networking Academy&#34;&gt;Cisco Networking Academy&lt;/a&gt; in the Exploration series I wanted to go ahead and take shot at the ICND1 exam. Now I knew that this was not going to be easy, by looking at online sites like CLN (Cisco Learning Network) and reading the horror stories of people missing by one point, having a hard time &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding&#34; title=&#34;Understanding&#34;&gt;understanding&lt;/a&gt; the material, not fully prepared, etc. But also reading success stories about how people passed and what they did to pass, really made me jump on the opportunity. Another thing that made me want to try it was the discounted price I was able to get, by going into the Cisco Networking Academy and doing fairly well I was able to apply for a voucher, which helped that determination I had when &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_skills&#34; title=&#34;Study skills&#34;&gt;studying&lt;/a&gt; for the ICND1 exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what did I do to pass this this exam?&lt;/strong&gt; 
Well although I finished the Cisco Networking Academy I needed to review the fundamental topics again. So I bought the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Official-Certification-Library-640-802-Containing/dp/1587201836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1300551785&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;CCNA Official Exam Certification Library (Exam 640-802), Third Edition (Containing ICND1 and ICND2 Second Edition Exam Certification Guides)&lt;/a&gt; I wanted something that really covered it all in one book, and I am very pleased that I went ahead and got it. But reading a book I don&#39;t think cuts it, you need to fully understand how to set up routers, and switches. That&#39;s where either packet tracer or access to physical equipment comes in. Since I am part of the Cisco Networking Academy I had access to physical and simulation software that I could use. One thing I can agree on is with Cisco &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_%28assessment%29&#34; title=&#34;Test (assessment)&#34;&gt;exams&lt;/a&gt; you want to make sure that you know how a set of commands work and know what they do and when to apply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how did I study and how long did it take me to study?&lt;/strong&gt;
Well at first I wanted to study alone I felt that I could get more done. However if possible I would suggest finding a friend that also wants to get certified or at least someone who you can teach the material to. I think I learned a lot more and having discussions with each other and it helped both of us understand the material. For the ICND1 exam it took three months of us studying and preparing for the exam. We mainly used the book from Wendell Odom and did some web searches for ICND1 practice questions. Another thing that helped me was joining the Cisco Learning Network. By asking and answering questions on the discussion pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I pass the ICND1 exam?&lt;/strong&gt;
Make sure you know the material. Its sounds simple but when I was taking the exam the questions I was given were questions that I would&#39;ve failed if I hadn&#39;t went over the book, online practice questions, and discussions. I felt confident in my answers, I was not second guessing myself and I knew the material inside and out. Another thing I did before taking the exam was go over the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/current_exams/640-822.html&#34;&gt;ICND1 exam topics.&lt;/a&gt; I made sure I could explain every topic that was listed.
 
In the end it shows as at the end of the exam I received an excellent score! Having said that there is always someone who wants the easy route and one thing I can say that &lt;strong&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; help you is a thing called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_dump&#34; title=&#34;Brain dump&#34;&gt;brain dumps&lt;/a&gt;. Which are questions that a person would memorize and some if not all are taken from the official exams. In addition you are violating the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement&#34; title=&#34;Non-disclosure agreement&#34;&gt;non-disclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#39;t understand why people would do this type of thing. To me it sounds like more work than to really just understand the material. It degrades the certification and really does not help anyone. So my advice is don&#39;t pay that amount of money because usually they are about has much as the official exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is my first time taking the exam what can I expect?&lt;/strong&gt;
Like you I was nervous so nervous, I reviewed and reviewed and went over everything again and again. I would agree to this which is you are battling with yourself. Relaxing is important and one thing I like when taking the Cisco exams is you start with a tutorial, I think this helps you get into the mode and you start to calm down. You have about 15 minutes to just breathe and get ready to take the exam and don&#39;t over think it! Simple questions usually want a simple answer. Although test taking tips help you have to know the material in the end to pass, you can&#39;t guess at this stuff. Set a goal and take the exam. Looking back I&#39;m glad I did. It showed that I&#39;m in right the career path and shows to employers that I know the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s next well I&#39;m taking a break this week, and will start again next week with some more Cisco information and tutorials. I&#39;m also going to start reviewing the ICND2 exam soon and currently I&#39;m estimating that this one will take longer than three months. :)&lt;/p&gt;
