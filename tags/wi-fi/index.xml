          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wifi_logo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wifi_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;WiFi_Logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wow July is almost over and I only posted one topic! Before August comes up I wanted to post at least one more topic which deals with the wireless side of the networking world. Ever heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Wi-Fi&#34; title=&#34;Super Wi-Fi&#34;&gt;Super WiFi&lt;/a&gt;? The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers&#34; title=&#34;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#34;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; has published this standard recently its official number is 802.22. What does Super WiFi bring to the table compared to other &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi&#34; title=&#34;Wi-Fi&#34;&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt; Standards? Well according to IEEE these speeds can bring up to 22Mbps to devices as far has 62 miles! How is this range possible? Well ever since the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&#34; title=&#34;United States&#34;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; made the switch to digital over the air broadcasts there was this &amp;quot;extra space&amp;quot; This space was at first used for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google&#34; title=&#34;Google&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and other big companies to experiment this &amp;quot;extra space&amp;quot; or also called white space. In September of 2010 the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission&#34; title=&#34;Federal Communications Commission&#34;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; approved this and it is now been standardized by the IEEE. The Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) is expected to use a point-to-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection&#34; title=&#34;Fuel injection&#34;&gt;multi-point&lt;/a&gt; system (P2MP) You can get more information by doing a simple search in your favorite search engine about this Super WiFi. I thought I posted about this way back in January but I guess not. What do you think? Do you think this technology will take off? In what parts of the country do you think this would be more popular? Personally I feel this would be excellent in rural areas of the United States. Also if you have an idea about any ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

On Monday I talked about the Basic Wireless Concepts (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) in that post I mentioned the wireless standards but did not go further into detail. This post will be going over the second standard 802.11a out of the five standards that make up the 802.11. The 802.11a was published in 1999 and operates in the 5GHz band instead of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz band&lt;/a&gt; because of this 802.11a uses only the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing&#34; title=&#34;Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing&#34;&gt;Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing&lt;/a&gt; (OFDM) which does have an advantage to still operate under severe channel conditions, like attenuation, and interference. The 802.11a in theory has maximum raw data rate of 54Mbit/s however because of the varied conditions you should expect 802.11a to have a maximum speed around 20Mbit/s. What is different between the 802.11a and other 802.11 standards is the fact that the 802.11a standard has 12 channels that are not overlapping each other. Since the 802.11a standard only operates in the 5GHz band it does not get has much interference compared to the 2.4GHz range. That&#39;s it for this summary for the 802.11a standard. Check back tomorrow and I&#39;ll be posting the 802.11b standard. I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackTrack&#34; title=&#34;BackTrack&#34;&gt;BackTrack&lt;/a&gt; is Linux  &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security&#34; title=&#34;Network security&#34;&gt;network security&lt;/a&gt; audit tool for security professionals. This tool is used for testing and penetrating networks. That being said** This tutorial is for educational use only. This is meant only to teach that WEP is an insecure option, and is recommend to use a harder encryption. Using this tutorial on a network that you do not have permission to access or is not yours, could be illegal! ** This was tested on BackTrack version 4 and the steps outlined in this tutorial were successful. (this tutorial is assuming that you have BackTrack 4 installed and are ready with a shell prompt)  The first thing you want to do is start your wireless interface in most cases this is wlan0 [code]airmon-ng start wlan0[/code] In the output look for the monitor interface in most cases this is mon0   The next thing you want to do is copy down the target AP&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29&#34; title=&#34;Service set (802.11 network)&#34;&gt;ESSID&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; of the AP,  also copy down the channel of the target AP.  [code]airodump-ng mon0[/code] There must be a client or clients using the AP if not you can&#39;t crack it. Match the MAC address of the AP to the available clients you have listed.   Next only output what you want (for example I have an AP on channel 8 and that MAC address of the AP is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and it&#39;s out monitor 0) the command would be:       [code]airodump-ng --channel 8 --write output --bssid 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 mon0[/code] (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is you want to associate your wireless card with the AP(for example I have the AP&#39;s MAC and ESSID (which is test) and my wireless MAC address (which is aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -1 0 -e test -a 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is start the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_injection&#34; title=&#34;Packet injection&#34;&gt;packet injection&lt;/a&gt; (for example you will need the target AP&#39;s MAC address (which is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and my(yours) wireless MAC address (which is 00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h 00:55:bb:DD:FF mon0[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The final step depends were the outputs are saved and the name of the output (for this example they were on /root and the name of the file was output-01.cap) so the command would look like:     [code]aircrack-ng output-01.cap[/code] Again this depends were the file was saved it could be in a different location. But after that command aircrack will attempt to crack the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy&#34; title=&#34;Wired Equivalent Privacy&#34;&gt;WEP key&lt;/a&gt; it will tell you that it either failed or if it was able to find it. (If it does fail wait for more packets and try again.)   The way aircrack works is that it reads the packet injection file, (this file is continues to update as packets move across the network) aircrack then finds the common key because that key is sent back and forth in the network. Depending on how active the network is aircrack is able to find the key in less than a minute!   Keep in mind when I was setting this up on a test AP I did run into some difficulties, although cracking a WEP key is relatively easy it still took me some time in troubleshooting. I hope this tutorial is helpful, you can find more information at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&lt;/a&gt; Also check my tutorial on &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/&#34; title=&#34;Install BackTrack&#34;&gt;Installing BackTrack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Some things are making news in the wireless world, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers&#34; title=&#34;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#34;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; wants another wireless standard in the mix called the  802.11ac, now the fastest standard they have is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11n-2009&#34;&gt;802.11n&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed&#34; title=&#34;Speed&#34;&gt;speeds&lt;/a&gt; up to 300 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units&#34; title=&#34;Data rate units&#34;&gt;Mbps&lt;/a&gt;), which was recently published in October of 2009. What is so great about the 802.11ac development? Well one thing is the speed, it is estimated that it will be able to carry up to 1 gigabit per second! The IEEE has been working on 802.11ac in 2009 and wants to put up a draft on it soon (this year). Products are not yet ready but could be around 2012. It is estimated that a billion 802.11ac devices could be expected in 2015. The standard will be using the existing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Radio spectrum&#34;&gt;radio spectrum&lt;/a&gt; in ranges below 6GHz and reports say it will have &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility&#34; title=&#34;Backward compatibility&#34;&gt;backwards compatibility&lt;/a&gt; for older devices. Frank Dickson said, “The goal of 802.11ac is to provide data speeds faster than 802.11n, with speeds of around 1Gbps,&amp;quot; he continued and said, “The timing for 802.11ac approval is to have a draft standard created by 2011 and have the first 802.11ac products out by the end of 2012.&amp;quot; So what does this mean to the average person? Well for the home user they probably would not see a difference if they were browsing online since &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider&#34; title=&#34;Internet service provider&#34;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; connection speeds are usually slower than LAN (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network&#34; title=&#34;Local area network&#34;&gt;Local Area Network&lt;/a&gt;) speeds. If the average person was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media&#34; title=&#34;Streaming media&#34;&gt;streaming videos&lt;/a&gt; from another computer within his home or transferring large files they would see a difference. This would be more towards businesses that don’t want to run cables to each computer, and would be more geared to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device&#34; title=&#34;Mobile device&#34;&gt;mobile devices&lt;/a&gt; like tablets, phones, laptops etc. Not much information is available as the 802.11ac is still under development. Which makes room for changing, but if you want to check out more information you can head over to the IEEE site at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ieee.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.ieee.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
