          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/thinking.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/thinking.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The thing that makes networks awesome is the fact that once you setup a network you&#39;re not done. That may sound like a drawback but it is excellent job security! Engineers or administrators must watch the performance of an organization&#39;s network to make sure that productivity is not affected. Network outages can have a huge effect on an organization, lost revenue and the cost of unproductive employees can severely damage the organization, Earlier this year I also talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/15/troubleshooting-process/&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting Process&#34;&gt;troubleshooting process&lt;/a&gt; which goes hand in hand with network troubleshooting. One of the major things a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator&#34; title=&#34;Network administrator&#34;&gt;network engineer&lt;/a&gt; or administrator needs to have is documentation of the network. That may sound like common sense and it is but with outdated documentation or no documentation at all makes it difficult to diagnose where the problem is and even more difficult if more help is needed from outside sources. Just with your computer, car and home, networks need to have a regular maintenance from time to time. Spending time on an operational network can improve its performance and uptime. Instead using the &amp;quot;duct tape&amp;quot; approach when outages occur. So we know documentation is important but it always seems to be on the backburner, &amp;quot;I&#39;ll get to it when there is time to burn&amp;quot; From my recent experience working with a hospital is that when things went down I had no idea where to start, the documentation was outdated twice over and let&#39;s just say the problem could have been fixed in 5 minutes instead of an hour. Needless to say I broke out &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visio&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft Visio&#34;&gt;Microsoft Visio&lt;/a&gt; and worked from the ground up. Having documentation is good idea but the kicker is to remember to update it when changes occur :). &lt;strong&gt;Simple problems are usually simple solutions&lt;/strong&gt;, we all have been there, a problem comes up 5 minutes before heading home and the problem itself is simple but for whatever reason the solution cannot be found. From my experience from troubleshooting labs and real world environments I have found that looking at the whole problem helps and take it one step at a time. For example a server or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer&#34; title=&#34;Personal computer&#34;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; no longer has &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_network&#34; title=&#34;Access network&#34;&gt;network access&lt;/a&gt;, does another PC or server that&#39;s on the same network able to use the resources needed? Continue to use the Troubleshooting Process and ask those simple questions until the solution is found. &lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t cover your tracks!&lt;/strong&gt; I have done this couple of times myself, when configuring a device like a router, switch, firewall etc. no matter how simple the configuration change seems to be always, copy the commands to a text file after you configured the device. Or better yet copy the commands to a text document first, read it through to make sure it seems correct and if something fails reverse the command. &lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t copy-run start!&lt;/strong&gt; This kind of goes with the one above but this method has saved me in some sketchy areas. When I take an already working device and throw some extra commands on it and now it disconnects from the network making an already problem worse than before. A simple reload or a pull of a power plug brings the device up before I made those changes. Once I have confirmed that those commands worked I then issue the famous copy run start command. &lt;strong&gt;Monitor your network,&lt;/strong&gt; How do you know what &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; looks like when you have nothing looking at it? There are tons of paid and free tools to help you find that &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; network load. So when something happens outside of normal you know about it. Some tools that I have worked with are &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paessler_Router_Traffic_Grapher&#34; title=&#34;Paessler Router Traffic Grapher&#34;&gt;PRTG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Router_Traffic_Grapher&#34; title=&#34;Multi Router Traffic Grapher&#34;&gt;MRTG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog&#34; title=&#34;Syslog&#34;&gt;Syslog&lt;/a&gt; servers like Kiwi Syslog, I have also heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagios&#34; title=&#34;Nagios&#34;&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whatsupgold.com/&#34; title=&#34;WhatsUp Gold&#34;&gt;WhatsUp Gold&lt;/a&gt;, and much more. A simple search will point you in the right direction ;). I hope this information is helpful when troubleshooting networks because although it can be a headache sometimes it&#39;s my favorite part of the job.

Before August comes up I wanted to post at least one more topic which deals with the wireless side of the networking world. Ever heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Wi-Fi&#34; title=&#34;Super Wi-Fi&#34;&gt;Super WiFi&lt;/a&gt;? The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers&#34; title=&#34;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#34;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; has published this standard recently its official number is 802.22. What does Super WiFi bring to the table compared to other &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi&#34; title=&#34;Wi-Fi&#34;&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt; Standards? Well according to IEEE these speeds can bring up to 22Mbps to devices as far has 62 miles! How is this range possible? Well ever since the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&#34; title=&#34;United States&#34;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; made the switch to digital over the air broadcasts there was this &amp;quot;extra space&amp;quot; This space was at first used for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google&#34; title=&#34;Google&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and other big companies to experiment this &amp;quot;extra space&amp;quot; or also called white space. In September of 2010 the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission&#34; title=&#34;Federal Communications Commission&#34;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; approved this and it is now been standardized by the IEEE. The Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) is expected to use a point-to-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection&#34; title=&#34;Fuel injection&#34;&gt;multi-point&lt;/a&gt; system (P2MP) You can get more information by doing a simple search in your favorite search engine about this Super WiFi. I thought I posted about this way back in January but I guess not. What do you think? Do you think this technology will take off? In what parts of the country do you think this would be more popular? Personally I feel this would be excellent in rural areas of the United States. Also if you have an idea about any ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/thinking.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/thinking.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today&#39;s post is going to be talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubleshooting&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; and where to start the troubleshooting process. Yes there is an actual process that every technician should be aware of. You can also use this troubleshooting process at home, you may not know how to fix it but at least you know where the issue is and find someone who can.  Before we begin if you haven&#39;t seen yet, let me introduce to you the troubleshooting process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to gather information about the problem. (What happened?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it simple, verify the obvious issues FIRST! (Is the device powered on?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try some quick solutions first (restart, reinstall, verify connections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather information from the device (Device Manger, if you are in routers or switches use &amp;quot;Show&amp;quot; commands and &amp;quot;Debug&amp;quot; commands)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your research skills! Evaluate the problem and try possible solutions. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet&#34; title=&#34;Internet&#34;&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; searches, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum&#34; title=&#34;Internet forum&#34;&gt;Online Forums&lt;/a&gt;, past experiences etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally keep note of what you did even if you did not fix the issue. (Keep an engineer notebook!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may look simple, and it is! This is the exact method I use when troubleshooting a problem. Troubleshooting is a hard skill to have, as you really can&#39;t learn from it in a book. You have to have experience with the type of technology you&#39;re working with. One thing I use all the time is my research skills this can be a life saver if you know what to look for, use key details! The internet can be helpful but putting generic terms like &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&#34; title=&#34;Windows XP&#34;&gt;windows XP&lt;/a&gt; is not working&amp;quot; will not help you but instead waste your time. Use the key terms when have an issue like an error code, type the error message, describe what you can&#39;t do, etc. Chances are somebody somewhere has had the same problem or at least something like it and decided to post it. Another thing I like to do when checking on a problem is going to the source! Although there are helpful places around web like forums, and chat systems I usually use this last. If I am having a problem with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft Windows&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; for example I&#39;ll go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Support. Same thing if I have an issue with a Cisco product I&#39;ll go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; Support webpage before I go and search my problem around the web. Finally remember ask other technicians if they have seen the problem. By using these steps and guidelines will be able to become better at troubleshooting like before it&#39;s something you can&#39;t learn from a book you must have experience with technology before you can even start troubleshooting. My last word of advice is keeping a record! Write down the steps you did, why did them and what where the solutions to the problem? If you couldn&#39;t figure it still write it down. That way if the issue occurs again you and other people know exactly how to fix the problem or also know what solutions not work last time and not waste any of your time, like always I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea about the next ICND1 or ICND2 topic comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cisco IDS vs. IPS</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/09/cisco-ids-vs.-ips/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;There are tons of network attacks out there. Using a firewall helps but does look for signature based attacks. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list&#34; title=&#34;Access control list&#34;&gt;Access Control Lists&lt;/a&gt; are like firewalls and only look at the protocols like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;File Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;FTP&lt;/a&gt; POP, etc. Cisco has developed some tools that will help &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator&#34; title=&#34;Network administrator&#34;&gt;network administrators&lt;/a&gt; combat the issue; IDS, (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion detection system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Detection System&lt;/a&gt;) and IPS. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion prevention system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Prevention System&lt;/a&gt;) Let&#39;s go into IDS first, Cisco IDS is a physical device and is like an alarm system it will alert you when an attack happens but that&#39;s it, the system won&#39;t block the connection. The IDS system is deployed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode&#34; title=&#34;Promiscuous mode&#34;&gt;promiscuous mode&lt;/a&gt; meaning the sensor is placed where it can hear all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic_control&#34; title=&#34;Network traffic control&#34;&gt;network traffic&lt;/a&gt; but is not in direct connect with the network making it an advantage when using an IDS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact, latency, or jitters etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact if there is a sensor failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact if there is a sensor overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the IDS does have some disadvantages compared to IPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If packets trigger an alarm that&#39;s all it does is tell us that an attack is happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct tuning is required for valid and invalid packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company must have a well thought-out security policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networks that are vulnerable must have evasion techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can IPS do that IDS can&#39;t? Well the IPS system can alert just like IDS but the IPS system can also block the attack. Remember that the IDS system can only alert. IPS works inline with the network it is a physical device just like IDS but is directly connected to the network. So what are the advantages to IPS compared to IDS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stops packets that trigger an alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can use stream normalization techniques (since the IPS sensor is inline with the traffic it can reduce many network attacks that exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the IDS the IPS does have disadvantage when compared to IDS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the sensor is connected directly (inline) with the network it might affect network traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sensor is overloaded that will also impact the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company must have a thought-out security policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be some latency, jitter etc. with the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why use IPS instead of IDS? Well IDS is an older technology and like mentioned before IDS only alerts you that an attack is happening, it logs the attack and that&#39;s it. Network attacks can happen fast and some of them only need a small amount of time to complete the attack. So once a network technician gets into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware&#34; title=&#34;Networking hardware&#34;&gt;network equipment&lt;/a&gt; the attacker could be long gone and got what he/she needed. Sure you can now fix the problem but it might be little too late. IPS is able to load signature files this is like the definitions on your anti-virus software which it looks for patterns based on the attack. Which IPS can take that same style and block those attacks based on the security policies you implement, along with alerting you of what happened. That&#39;s my brief rundown of what these two technologies do  there is a lot more information you will be able to find on the web. But both have their places in the networking environment and it all depends on the money the company wants to spend to keep their networks secure. You can find more information at Cisco.com and or other places, I hope this information was informative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Laser Printing Process</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/08/laser-printing-process/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s move away from Cisco for at least a day, So this post will be talking about the six steps in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_printer&#34; title=&#34;Laser printer&#34;&gt;laser printing&lt;/a&gt; process, this is good for technicians who fix or repair printers along with a good learning experience. With my limited knowledge of printers I used this process to at least help diagnose the problem. If you have no idea how a printer works, I would not try to fix it. People have become hurt with these machines leave it to the professionals.   Step 1: Cleaning When an image has been deposited on the paper and the drum has separated from the paper, any remaining &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toner&#34; title=&#34;Toner&#34;&gt;toner&lt;/a&gt; must be removed from the drum. A printer may have a blade that scrapes all excess toner from the drum. Some printers use an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current&#34; title=&#34;Alternating current&#34;&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt; voltage on a wire that removes the charge from the drum surface and allows the excess toner to fall away from the drum. The excess toner is stored in a used toner container that may be emptied or discarded. Step 2: Conditioning This step involves removing the old latent image from the drum and conditioning the drum for a new latent image. Conditioning is done by placing a special wire, grid, or roller that receives a negative charge of about – 600 volts &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current&#34; title=&#34;Direct current&#34;&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt; uniformly across the surface of the drum. The charged wire or grid is called the primary corona. The roller is called a conditioning roller. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/08/laser-printing-process/printing/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/printing.png?w=294&#34; alt=&#34;The Printing Steps&#34; title=&#34;Printing&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/printing.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Step 3: Writing The writing process involves scanning the photosensitive drum with the laser beam. Every part of the drum that is exposed to the light has the surface charge reduced to about – 100 volts DC. This &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge&#34; title=&#34;Electric charge&#34;&gt;electrical charge&lt;/a&gt; has a lower negative charge than the remainder of the drum. As the drum turns, an invisible latent image is created on the drum.   Step 4: Developing In the developing phase, the toner is applied to the latent image on the drum. The toner is a negatively-charged combination of plastic and metal particles. A control blade holds the toner at a microscopic distance from the drum. The toner then moves from the control blade to the more positively-charged latent image on the drum.   Step 5: Transferring In this step, the toner attached to the latent image is transferred to the paper. The transfer, or secondary corona, places a positive charge on the paper. Because the drum was charged negatively, the toner on the drum is attracted to the paper. The image is now on the paper and is held in place by the positive charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Fusing In this step, the toner is permanently fused to the paper. The printing paper is rolled between a heated roller and a pressure roller. As the paper moves through the heated roller and the pressure roller, the loose toner is melted and fused with the fibers in the paper. The paper is then moved to the output tray as a printed page. That&#39;s the laser printer process! If you took anything from this you should now at least  know the steps of how a laser printer works and that could be a topic starter!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Corporation&#34; title=&#34;Intel Corporation&#34;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; announced on Friday (February 25th 2011) the new high speed connector that will coexists with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus&#34; title=&#34;Universal Serial Bus&#34;&gt;USB 3.0&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.&#34; title=&#34;Apple Inc.&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; also announced that it will be appearing first on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro&#34; title=&#34;MacBook Pro&#34;&gt;MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. Thunderbolt known before has &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Peak&#34; title=&#34;Light Peak&#34;&gt;Light Peak&lt;/a&gt; is a new high-speed PC connection &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology&#34; title=&#34;Technology&#34;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;. This cable can combine data and high-definition all in one cable running at 10Gbps. So you could say it is like the all in wonder &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI&#34; title=&#34;HDMI&#34;&gt;HDMI cable&lt;/a&gt; that combines video and audio into one cable. How fast is 10Gbps? Well if you had a full length HD movie so on average 120 minutes it would be able to transfer that movie in less than 30 seconds!! Although the codename was called Light Peak Intel Is running the new technology as an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current&#34; title=&#34;Electric current&#34;&gt;electrical current&lt;/a&gt; based on copper. Intel has said that it will work and move the technology over to optical but not schedule has been released yet. This Thunderbolt technology will not replace USB 3.0 according to Jason Ziller, an Intel manager, &amp;quot;They will co-exist on the same platform...in terms of storage (devices) we&#39;ll see both products on the market&amp;quot;. You can read more information at Intel&#39;s website in the press room about the Thunderbolt Technology. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011/02/24/thunderbolt-technology-the-fastest-data-connection-to-your-pc-just-arrived?cid=rss-258152-c1-264729&#34;&gt;Thunderbolt Technology: The Fastest Data Connection to Your PC Just Arrived&lt;/a&gt;) This technology is pretty cool, but the question is will it take off. Consumers have to buy it in order for it to be a success. Also Apple kind of took the product, although Apple did have some say in the Thunderbolt Technology it feels like at least for now that only Apple will have this. I am throwing a guess that other manufactures are waiting to see if this is a hit or a flop. What do think? Comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>802.11ac Standard</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/21/802.11ac-standard/</link>

          &lt;p&gt;Some things are making news in the wireless world, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers&#34; title=&#34;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&#34;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; wants another wireless standard in the mix called the  802.11ac, now the fastest standard they have is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11n-2009&#34;&gt;802.11n&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed&#34; title=&#34;Speed&#34;&gt;speeds&lt;/a&gt; up to 300 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units&#34; title=&#34;Data rate units&#34;&gt;Mbps&lt;/a&gt;), which was recently published in October of 2009. What is so great about the 802.11ac development? Well one thing is the speed, it is estimated that it will be able to carry up to 1 gigabit per second! The IEEE has been working on 802.11ac in 2009 and wants to put up a draft on it soon (this year). Products are not yet ready but could be around 2012. It is estimated that a billion 802.11ac devices could be expected in 2015. The standard will be using the existing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Radio spectrum&#34;&gt;radio spectrum&lt;/a&gt; in ranges below 6GHz and reports say it will have &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility&#34; title=&#34;Backward compatibility&#34;&gt;backwards compatibility&lt;/a&gt; for older devices. Frank Dickson said, “The goal of 802.11ac is to provide data speeds faster than 802.11n, with speeds of around 1Gbps,&amp;quot; he continued and said, “The timing for 802.11ac approval is to have a draft standard created by 2011 and have the first 802.11ac products out by the end of 2012.&amp;quot; So what does this mean to the average person? Well for the home user they probably would not see a difference if they were browsing online since &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider&#34; title=&#34;Internet service provider&#34;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; connection speeds are usually slower than LAN (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network&#34; title=&#34;Local area network&#34;&gt;Local Area Network&lt;/a&gt;) speeds. If the average person was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media&#34; title=&#34;Streaming media&#34;&gt;streaming videos&lt;/a&gt; from another computer within his home or transferring large files they would see a difference. This would be more towards businesses that don’t want to run cables to each computer, and would be more geared to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device&#34; title=&#34;Mobile device&#34;&gt;mobile devices&lt;/a&gt; like tablets, phones, laptops etc. Not much information is available as the 802.11ac is still under development. Which makes room for changing, but if you want to check out more information you can head over to the IEEE site at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ieee.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.ieee.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
