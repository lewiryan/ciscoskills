          &lt;p&gt;In today&#39;s post let&#39;s talk about CDP the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Discovery_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Discovery Protocol&#34;&gt;Cisco Discovery Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. This protocol helps us in two ways, it first helps us verify that a connection between &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router&#34; title=&#34;Router&#34;&gt;router&lt;/a&gt; or switch is set up correctly  at least up to layer two in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt;. This also helps us discover &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; devices that are in are network and which &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_%28computing%29&#34; title=&#34;Interface (computing)&#34;&gt;interfaces&lt;/a&gt; these devices are connected too and from are Cisco equipment. The Cisco discovery protocol is Cisco proprietary  and before I go any further let me mention that CDP is a security risk because of the detailed &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information&#34; title=&#34;Information&#34;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; CDP gives out which helps you has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator&#34; title=&#34;Network administrator&#34;&gt;network administrator&lt;/a&gt; build a current network infrastructure, this can also hurt you because this information can easily be sniffed by programs that are easily searched on the internet. So what is the purpose of CDP? CDP can gather device information from neighboring switches and routers without the need for a password. Like mentioned before this is great for troubleshooting a problem, discovering new devices that are not documented in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology&#34; title=&#34;Network topology&#34;&gt;network topology&lt;/a&gt;, and verifying that each device is physically connected to the correct interfaces according to network documentation. CDP can discover the following details from neighboring devices that support CDP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device Identifier: The hostname of the device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address List: Network and data-link addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local Interface: The interface on the switch or router issuing the command &lt;em&gt;Show CDP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port Identifier: Identifies the port used by the device to send CDP messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capabilities List: Information on what the device is like a router or a switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform: The model and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system&#34; title=&#34;Operating system&#34;&gt;OS&lt;/a&gt; running on the device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since CDP is enabled by default it does create a security risk, Cisco recommends that CDP be disabled on all interfaces that do not have need for it. You can disable CDP in two ways, by each interface with the sub-command &lt;em&gt;no cdp enable&lt;/em&gt; under the interface you wish to disable CDP. Or you can also disable CDP globally within the router or switch with the command &lt;em&gt;no cdp run&lt;/em&gt; under the configuration mode. That&#39;s just some general information about CDP and why CDP is useful. Although CDP could be a security risk it&#39;s still a helpful protocol to get some detailed information about your Cisco devices for inventory or to update your network topology. It can also be useful to just verify that the physical layer and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Link_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Data Link Layer&#34;&gt;data-link layer&lt;/a&gt; are working correctly for troubleshooting purposes. Like always I hope this information is informative and if you have an idea on the next topic that deals with wither ICND1 or ICND2 let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/thinking.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/thinking.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today&#39;s post is going to be talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubleshooting&#34; title=&#34;Troubleshooting&#34;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; and where to start the troubleshooting process. Yes there is an actual process that every technician should be aware of. You can also use this troubleshooting process at home, you may not know how to fix it but at least you know where the issue is and find someone who can.  Before we begin if you haven&#39;t seen yet, let me introduce to you the troubleshooting process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to gather information about the problem. (What happened?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it simple, verify the obvious issues FIRST! (Is the device powered on?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try some quick solutions first (restart, reinstall, verify connections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather information from the device (Device Manger, if you are in routers or switches use &amp;quot;Show&amp;quot; commands and &amp;quot;Debug&amp;quot; commands)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your research skills! Evaluate the problem and try possible solutions. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet&#34; title=&#34;Internet&#34;&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; searches, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum&#34; title=&#34;Internet forum&#34;&gt;Online Forums&lt;/a&gt;, past experiences etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally keep note of what you did even if you did not fix the issue. (Keep an engineer notebook!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may look simple, and it is! This is the exact method I use when troubleshooting a problem. Troubleshooting is a hard skill to have, as you really can&#39;t learn from it in a book. You have to have experience with the type of technology you&#39;re working with. One thing I use all the time is my research skills this can be a life saver if you know what to look for, use key details! The internet can be helpful but putting generic terms like &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&#34; title=&#34;Windows XP&#34;&gt;windows XP&lt;/a&gt; is not working&amp;quot; will not help you but instead waste your time. Use the key terms when have an issue like an error code, type the error message, describe what you can&#39;t do, etc. Chances are somebody somewhere has had the same problem or at least something like it and decided to post it. Another thing I like to do when checking on a problem is going to the source! Although there are helpful places around web like forums, and chat systems I usually use this last. If I am having a problem with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft Windows&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; for example I&#39;ll go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Support. Same thing if I have an issue with a Cisco product I&#39;ll go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems&#34; title=&#34;Cisco Systems&#34;&gt;Cisco&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; Support webpage before I go and search my problem around the web. Finally remember ask other technicians if they have seen the problem. By using these steps and guidelines will be able to become better at troubleshooting like before it&#39;s something you can&#39;t learn from a book you must have experience with technology before you can even start troubleshooting. My last word of advice is keeping a record! Write down the steps you did, why did them and what where the solutions to the problem? If you couldn&#39;t figure it still write it down. That way if the issue occurs again you and other people know exactly how to fix the problem or also know what solutions not work last time and not waste any of your time, like always I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea about the next ICND1 or ICND2 topic comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cisco IDS vs. IPS</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/cisco-ids-vs.-ips/</link>

          &lt;p&gt;There are tons of network attacks out there. Using a firewall helps but does look for signature based attacks. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list&#34; title=&#34;Access control list&#34;&gt;Access Control Lists&lt;/a&gt; are like firewalls and only look at the protocols like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;File Transfer Protocol&#34;&gt;FTP&lt;/a&gt; POP, etc. Cisco has developed some tools that will help &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator&#34; title=&#34;Network administrator&#34;&gt;network administrators&lt;/a&gt; combat the issue; IDS, (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion detection system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Detection System&lt;/a&gt;) and IPS. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system&#34; title=&#34;Intrusion prevention system&#34;&gt;Intrusion Prevention System&lt;/a&gt;) Let&#39;s go into IDS first, Cisco IDS is a physical device and is like an alarm system it will alert you when an attack happens but that&#39;s it, the system won&#39;t block the connection. The IDS system is deployed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode&#34; title=&#34;Promiscuous mode&#34;&gt;promiscuous mode&lt;/a&gt; meaning the sensor is placed where it can hear all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic_control&#34; title=&#34;Network traffic control&#34;&gt;network traffic&lt;/a&gt; but is not in direct connect with the network making it an advantage when using an IDS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact, latency, or jitters etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact if there is a sensor failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network impact if there is a sensor overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the IDS does have some disadvantages compared to IPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If packets trigger an alarm that&#39;s all it does is tell us that an attack is happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct tuning is required for valid and invalid packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company must have a well thought-out security policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networks that are vulnerable must have evasion techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can IPS do that IDS can&#39;t? Well the IPS system can alert just like IDS but the IPS system can also block the attack. Remember that the IDS system can only alert. IPS works inline with the network it is a physical device just like IDS but is directly connected to the network. So what are the advantages to IPS compared to IDS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stops packets that trigger an alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can use stream normalization techniques (since the IPS sensor is inline with the traffic it can reduce many network attacks that exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the IDS the IPS does have disadvantage when compared to IDS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the sensor is connected directly (inline) with the network it might affect network traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sensor is overloaded that will also impact the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company must have a thought-out security policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be some latency, jitter etc. with the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why use IPS instead of IDS? Well IDS is an older technology and like mentioned before IDS only alerts you that an attack is happening, it logs the attack and that&#39;s it. Network attacks can happen fast and some of them only need a small amount of time to complete the attack. So once a network technician gets into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware&#34; title=&#34;Networking hardware&#34;&gt;network equipment&lt;/a&gt; the attacker could be long gone and got what he/she needed. Sure you can now fix the problem but it might be little too late. IPS is able to load signature files this is like the definitions on your anti-virus software which it looks for patterns based on the attack. Which IPS can take that same style and block those attacks based on the security policies you implement, along with alerting you of what happened. That&#39;s my brief rundown of what these two technologies do  there is a lot more information you will be able to find on the web. But both have their places in the networking environment and it all depends on the money the company wants to spend to keep their networks secure. You can find more information at Cisco.com and or other places, I hope this information was informative.&lt;/p&gt;
