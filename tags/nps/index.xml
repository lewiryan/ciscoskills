          &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/safe-access-control.png&#34; alt=&#34;safe-access-control&#34;&gt;In this configuration I&#39;m at looking at using Microsoft NPS 2012 R2 as radius server and I’m going to skip the installation of NPS because it really is just a next, next, finish installation. In this demo I already have this NPS system connected to a Windows domain, my goal is to create role based access on Cisco IOS routers while using radius to login. I’ll have a couple for active directory accounts each them will represent different types of allowed access to these IOS routers. One account will get full administrative access while the other will only get read access, how cool cat is that ;) !  We have to get some house-cleaning things done first before we jump into it. To keep this simple in this example I&#39;m only using one router and this router is able to reach the radius server. I’ll have to create an enable secret on the device, create a local username with a password, and turn AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting). I like to create my own AAA method lists one for the console logins and one for remote logins here is what I got so far: [code] enable secret 0 cisco username admin privilege 15 secret 0 cisco aaa new-model aaa authentication login OPEN-CONSOLE none aaa authentication login RADIUS-LOCAL group radius local-case aaa authorization exec default group radius if-authenticated [/code] The router needs to know where radius server is located, we also need to put in a radius key and this needs to match between both the router and radius server. [code] radius server RADIUS address ipv4 192.168.5.10 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 key cisco123 [/code] If our router has more than one active interface we also should specify which IP interface we want the radius information to come from. In this example GigabitEthernet 0/1 will be the source interface. [code] ip radius source-interface GigabitEthernet0/1 [/code] Apply this AAA method to the console and VTY ports: [code] line con 0 login authentication OPEN-CONSOLE exit line vty 0 4 login authentication RADIUS-LOCAL[/code] The magic begins with the Microsoft NPS server although any radius server is just as magical. We first have to create our client list within the Microsoft NPS. I have just used the defaults and have kept note of the radius key we configured earlier. This is pretty simple, expand the Radius Clients and Servers folder and right-click on Radius Clients and select new. &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-1&#34;&gt; A new window will show, populate the information with a friendly name of the device you wish to add, IP address of the device and the radius key. After that select OK. &lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Make sure the address matches to what you have configured as the source-interface on the router in this example it was GigabitEthernet0/1.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-2&#34;&gt; Once we have the all the clients in the client list we can now go to the Connection Request Polices. I usually just delete the existing policy, &lt;em&gt;Use Windows authentication for all users&lt;/em&gt; and create a new policy called &lt;em&gt;Radius-Login&lt;/em&gt;. Right-click on the Connection Request Policy folder, select new and follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a policy name and click next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a condition, (I usually do a a day and time condition and select the time frame you want logins to occur. Select next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the defaults, Authenticate requests on this server, select next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t override anything, select next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the defaults which is blank on everything, select next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the Connection Request Policy summary page it should look like something like below, select finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-3&#34;&gt; Go to the Network Policy Folder you will see some policies already created, delete those policies. We are going to create our own and the first policy is going to be a Network Administrators policy which will give full access to the IOS router if the user belongs to the correct Windows Security group. Right-click on the Network Policy folder and select new, new window will appear. Type in the policy name. In this example I&#39;m using &lt;em&gt;Allow Network Administrators - Administrative Access&lt;/em&gt;, select next. Under conditions select User Groups and in this example I have already created a security group on the Windows directory called &lt;em&gt;Network Administrators&lt;/em&gt;, select next. On the following screen grant access and select next as well. &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-4.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-4&#34;&gt; In the Authentication Methods clear the following check-boxes and select the Unencrypted Authentication (PAP, SPAP), select next and disregard the warning. On the following screen &lt;strong&gt;Configure Constraints&lt;/strong&gt; accept the defaults select next. &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-5.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-5.png&#34;&gt; We should be at the Configure Settings page, under the Radius Attributes delete the existing attributes and add &lt;em&gt;Service-Type Administrative&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-6.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-6&#34;&gt; Under Vendor Specific we need to add to a Cisco-AV Pair to tell the router to go to privilege level 15, select next when you add the &lt;strong&gt;shell:priv-lvl=15&lt;/strong&gt; in the Cisco-AV. &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-7.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-7&#34;&gt; You are now at the summary page and it should pretty similar to what I have below, select Finish! &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-8.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-8&#34;&gt; You have now just created your first radius network policy. If all is well and if you have a user in Windows Security group you should be able to login into the router via radius. In this example I was able to login into the HQ router with my Windows active directory username and password.

How would we be able to do this with radius? Well with Cisco IOS you can use parser views, basically you configure a parser view on the IOS router call it name and configure the view to only allow the commands you want. You configure the radius server to pass the name of the parser view you created on the IOS router, if the parser view name matches the router will put that user into that view and only allow the user to use the commands that are configured in that view. More information about parser views can be found on Cisco website: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t7/feature/guide/gtclivws.html&#34;&gt;Role-Based CLI Access &lt;/a&gt; So in this example we are going to create a parser view called SHOWMODE and only allow show commands. In the enable prompt we want to be in &amp;quot;root view mode&amp;quot; to do this we would type enable view, the router is going to be asking for a password and that is your enable secret password you created at the beginning of this post. &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you have Radius enabled you will have to at least disable the client in NPS when you are first configuring a parser view. By disabling the client in NPS the router will fail-back to its local database of username and passwords to authenticate. The reason for this is because the router will try to use the NPS server to authenticate, this may not sound like a problem but the router is not using your username when you issue the command enable view. If your radius server has logging enabled you&#39;ll see that the router is using a different username called root. Since root is not in our Windows Active Directory the radius server will reject the request. Although you could create a user called root in Windows Active directory and put that user in the correct security groups to allow logins using radius that just doesn&#39;t sound like a good idea. The simplest method is to disable the client in NPS and use your enable secret password. Give it a second or two as this has to timeout before it fails-back to the local username and password database.&lt;/em&gt; [code] login as: ryan ************************************************************************** * IOSv is strictly limited to use for evaluation, demonstration and IOS * * education.

HQ# HQ#enable view Password: HQ#show privilege Currently in View Context with view &#39;root&#39; HQ# [/code] Now that we have verified we are in &amp;quot;root view&amp;quot; let&#39;s go to configuration mode and create a parser view called SHOWMODE. We also have to create another secret password this should be different from the enable secret. [code] HQ(config)#parser view SHOWMODE HQ(config-view)#secret 0 cisco123 [/code] Once we have the password created we can tell the router what commands we want to allow in this view. In this example we are only allowing show commands so the command would be: [code]HQ(config-view)#commands exec include all show HQ(config-view)#exit HQ(config)#exit [/code] We can test this parser view by going into it by using the command enable view SHOWMODE. We are prompt for the password to enter this view (Again the client on NPS should be disabled so that we can use our local username and password database on the router). [code] HQ#enable view SHOWMODE Password: HQ#show privilege Currently in View Context with view &#39;SHOWMODE&#39; HQ# [/code] If I issue a question mark (?) I get a list of the commands I can issue: (It looks I can only use show commands) [code] HQ#? Exec commands: &amp;lt;1-99&amp;gt; Session number to resume do-exec Mode-independent &amp;quot;do-exec&amp;quot; prefix support enable Turn on privileged commands exit Exit from the EXEC show Show running system information HQ# [/code] So we have created a parser view on our router now lets configure our Microsoft NPS server to use that parser view when our junior technician logs into this router. We have to create a new network policy in NPS. In this example I&#39;m calling it &lt;em&gt;Allow Network Operators - Read Only&lt;/em&gt;. Follow the steps you did before when we first created the Network Administrators policy the only difference of course is going to be a different Windows Active Directory security group and our radius attributes. We only need to focus on the Vendor Specific section of the network policy under the radius attributes section. We need to add a different Cisco AV-Pair called &lt;em&gt;shell:cli-view-name=SHOWMODE&lt;/em&gt; and also add the &lt;em&gt;shell:priv-lvl=15&lt;/em&gt; It would look something like this, select next. &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-9.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-9&#34;&gt; We now should be at the summary screen of the new policy we just created and to give you a reference here is what I have for this example. &lt;img src=&#34;https://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/nps-10-e.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPS-10-E&#34;&gt; Once we select finish we should be able to login to our router but this time it is going to be using the parser view we created. Joe is another account I have created in Windows Active Directory and this account is part of the network operators security group. Here is what I have when Joe logs into the router.

Believe it or not that&#39;s it for this post. We have created policies on Microsoft NPS server as well as created parser views to limit access based on user accounts and tied it all together using radius. I hope this this information is helpful in helping you build a better RBAC with your network devices!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Darkpenguin, Privilege levels are hierarchical where as parser views are role based, so they are two different things. I can specifically call out different commands to use under a parser view regardless if its at a lower or higher privilege level. If you look at the example where the username Joe logs into the router, although this account has privilege level 15 this account is tied to a parser view called SHOWMODE. This account could only do show commands regardless what the privilege level was set. I really don&#39;t need to worry about privilege levels if I&#39;m using parser views, however you could give them a lower privilege level but I think the end result would be the same, they would only be able to use show commands on that lower privilege level. So I&#39;m not sure what benefit you would get from putting this group at a lower privilege level. Ryan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why add the &amp;quot;shell:priv-lvl=15&amp;quot; to the view only group?&lt;/p&gt;
