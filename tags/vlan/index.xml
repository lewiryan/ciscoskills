            Let&#39;s start out 2018 with private VLANs, with PVLANs the network gets a little more privacy added to it. When we have privacy on the network we can seclude certain parts of it. Essentially, &amp;quot;you can go about your business - move along, move along&amp;quot;. Private VLANs allow us to segment networks within a single VLAN. So in this post we&#39;ll go over the types of PVLANs as well as setup a network topology with private VLANs, Let&#39;s get started!

            VACLs are another good layer of security to help control who can talk to who, much likeÂ access control lists that are in firewalls and routers, however the difference is VACLs operate at layer two of the OSI model. There could be situations where you have multiple hosts on the same LAN and want to block traffic from reaching certain hosts within that same network, how would you go about blocking that type of traffic without using a router or firewall?
