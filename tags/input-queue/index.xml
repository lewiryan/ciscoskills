            Networks are becoming more &amp;quot;borderless&amp;quot; as Cisco likes to call it and it&#39;s definitely true. Having the ability to get access to resources remotely without having to be at our office physically is a nice touch, you may even notice higher productivity and who doesn&#39;t want that! Networks have to be in a healthy state in order for people remotely and people at the office to get their work done.
