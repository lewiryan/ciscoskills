            In this simple tutorial we are going to be configuring a static NAT which is a one-to-one mapping between an inside IP address and an outside IP address. (One private to one permanent address) Using this type of NAT would be helpful for outside devices accessing your inside devices. (Like a web server) Let&#39;s get started!!
Looking at the topology above you can see that we have a server inside of are network and want people to access this server outside of are network.
