          &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; word we don&#39;t like to hear, and often times it has degraded networks or even took them down entirely.  (&lt;a href=&#34;https://ciscoskills.net/files/2019/01/All-Systems-Down.pdf&#34;&gt;All Systems Down&lt;/a&gt; - an older but classic story) It&#39;s also one of those things that nobody really likes, we even had network companies, as well as IEEE &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; to replace it with something else. Remember the names like TRILL, and IEEE 802.1aq (SPB) or Cisco&#39;s FabicPath technologies? You had all of these different flavors that showed a lot progress, but they never really took off for one reason or another. The funny part is this protocol we are all trying kill off is still alive and doing well, so let&#39;s look at spanning tree in the meantime because you will likely run into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember there are multiple types of spanning tree protocols but they all have a common theme to them and in this post we are going to be focusing on those common themes. If you need a refresher about the reasons and basic functions of spanning tree you can check out these posts I did quite a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ciscoskills.net/2011/08/10/the-beginnings-of-layer-two-redundancy/&#34;&gt;The Beginnings of Layer Two Redundancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/09/07/the-middle-of-layer-two-redundancy/&#34;&gt;The Middle of Layer Two Redundancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ciscoskills.net/2011/09/14/the-%e2%80%9cending%e2%80%9d-of-layer-two-redundancy//&#34;&gt;The “Ending” of Layer Two Redundancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we should already know that by default spanning tree is enabled on all ports when the switch has blank config. There are of course tweaks we can do to adjust convergence times like using RSTP, if thirty seconds is too long, using portfast when there is not another switch downstream, lots of customization. Here is a simple topology, two switches two links, one of links will be blocked otherwise expect loops and network inconsistency.

&lt;p&gt;Out of the box STP will protect you from loops, and a simple way to figure what type of spanning tree protocol is running as well as to figure out who is root you can use this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;SW2#show spanning-tree 
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;VLAN0001
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;  Spanning tree enabled protocol rstp

&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;             Address     aabb.cc00.0200
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;             This bridge is the root

&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;             Address     aabb.cc00.0200
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;             Hello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;             Aging Time  300 sec
&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that we are on the root bridge, by looking at &lt;strong&gt;Root ID&lt;/strong&gt; information. This shows information about who is root and in this case we are on the root switch, seeing the message &lt;em&gt;This bridge is the root&lt;/em&gt;, confirms that. We can also see the type of spanning tree protocol we are running, which is RSTP. Running the command on the other switch, that is not root we can the BLK status on one of its ports (Et0/1) which is what we are expecting. We can also see who is root. If we look at the &lt;strong&gt;Bridge ID&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s the local switch we are on. Notice when you are the root switch both the Root ID and Bridge match. So our topology looks like something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So by default spanning tree helped us block a redundant path without us really doing anything. So why bother with it? Well there is always fine tuning like turning on portfast which is used for edge devices, timers for STP to make it converge faster. There are also some protections that should be enabled like using BPDU guard which help guard the spanning tree topology from introducing unauthorized devices from sending BPDUs and usually used on access ports. Another one is Root guard which is used to help protect the root bridge from changing. Root guard is similar to BPDU guard but I like to think this protection is for us network engineers for when we introduce a switch into the network that somehow as a lower priority than the existing root bridge we can protect the network from changing the STP topology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;failures&#34;&gt;Failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I doing a good job of making this protocol shine? Well like everything there is always another side of it and I would say some of the failures can be a misconfiguration, software incompatibilities/bugs (which is more common than you would think) and overgrowth of the STP design. When this happens the STP topology can become disruptive to the entire layer two design while trying to reconverge into a new shape, meanwhile switch CPUs hit all time highs and network availability hits all zeros. Another valid point is its a waste of money, you buy two of everything but you can&#39;t use both at the same time because you can&#39;t have multiple L2 paths. Sure you can add MLAGs/vPCs but spanning tree is still running and if that protocol becomes unstable, or changes the topology it has the potential to still be disruptive. ...and this is why a lot people dislike this technology, It really wasn&#39;t designed for high-availability, multi-path, layer two domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;move-up-a-layer&#34;&gt;Move up a layer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally L2/L3 boundary is at the distribution/aggregation layer of the network, but this traditional design is changing to IP routing at the access layer (Routed Access Layer) to remove spanning tree However this may work well for client/end-user access, this type of design fails at the data center. You may have racks of servers in your data center, you want the maximum amount a flexibility to move hardware around as well as add additional hardware in the future.  If you did a routed access layer at the data center, you start to lock yourself in and although its 2019 a lot applications still operate at a layer two level and even if the apps you are running don&#39;t have that problem you run into scalability issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;smoke-and-mirrors&#34;&gt;Smoke and Mirrors?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where&#39;s the magic? How do you use a reliable layer three network like you did in on the client/end-user side but put it in a data center? Think network overlays like VxLAN or BGP EVPN, (EVPN BGP),  (order does not matter, they&#39;re the same thing) 😉 Basically these are network overlay technologies, you have you underlayer network that is running and you put this technology on top of that network, I call it network virtualization but you may have also heard SDN, (Software Define Networking). Whatever you want to call it this is how you kill spanning tree. Spanning tree by default just runs on a layer two network, we saw that from the beginning. So you remove layer two from the entire stack and then overlay an additional network on top of that. Using these type of technologies your applications don&#39;t know the difference. Another helpful post I saw when reading about overlay networks was from David Varnum&#39;s post about how Arista Networks uses BGP EVPN, pretty neat technology, if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://overlaid.net/2018/08/27/arista-bgp-evpn-overview-and-concepts/&#34;&gt;Arista BGP EVPN – Overview and Concepts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>640-911 (Chapter 12 &amp; 13)</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2014/04/19/640-911-chapter-12-13/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2014 16:36:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ciscoskills.net/2014/04/19/640-911-chapter-12-13/</guid>
      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;We are at the last chapters of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Data-Center-Introducing-Networking/dp/1118661265/&#34;&gt;CCNA Data Center 640-911 by Todd Lammle&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 12 talks about redundant switched technologies and chapter 13 talks about security. Just like before I will go over the high-points, so let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 12 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: In this chapter we get to learn about Spanning Tree Protocol and some history with it. With networks we like multiple ways to a destination however in the layer two area redundancy does not play well and that’s where spanning tree can help us. So know what spanning tree and its purpose. Spanning tree has several terms that are important to remember for the exam, I would look over page 387. For the exam know some show commands for spanning tree, like &lt;strong&gt;show spanning-tree&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;show spanning-tree summary&lt;/strong&gt;. This chapter also talked about the different types of spanning-tree but could not tell if this would be on 640-911 exam as well as port-channels which helps eliminate blocked STP ports. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 13 Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: In the last chapter of 640-911 book we get introduced to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/07/access-control-lists/&#34; title=&#34;Access Control Lists&#34;&gt;access-control-lists&lt;/a&gt; and the types of access-lists that the NX-OS supports, know the difference as well as configuring a standard access list and extended access list also be sure to understand the implicit deny statement at end of every access-list. I would also know how wildcard masking works, (flip the subnet mask). A couple more things I thought would be important to keep an eye out is understand that once an access-list is created that does not mean its active, make you sure to understand how to apply the ACL on an interface. Finally know your show commands for access-lists, like &lt;strong&gt;show access-list&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;show access-list summary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: So thanks for checking out these posts about the 640-911 exam, I hope this give you an idea of what to expect on the exam and good luck, if you decide to take it. Personally I am shooting for May/June timeframe to pass at least the 640-911. I thought this book was helpful but if you went and passed the CCNA or even CCNP it does get a little dry in areas. This exam is introductory but required if you wanted to achieve the CCNA Data Center certification. Remember you need to pass two exams 640-911 and the 640-916 to become CCNA Data Center certified. Check out all the 640-911 exam topics: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ciscoskills.net/files/2014/01/640-911_dcicn.pdf&#34;&gt;640-911 Exam Topics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little off topic but interesting to note is as of this writing Todd Lammle is the only author that has published a study guide for the CCNA Data Center, a quick check on Amazon shows that Cisco Press is ready to roll out an official certification guide for the 640-911 in the end of August authored by a Wendell Odom, followed by the 640-916 in January of 2015. I’ll end it here, I hope this information is helpful and comment below if you have any questions on these chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Middle of Layer Two Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://ciscoskills.net/2011/09/07/the-middle-of-layer-two-redundancy/</link>

      <description>
        
          &lt;p&gt;In the month of August I talked about the &amp;quot;beginnings&amp;quot; of layer two &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_%28engineering%29&#34; title=&#34;Redundancy (engineering)&#34;&gt;redundancy&lt;/a&gt; mainly looking at the basic foundations and fundamentals of having layer two redundancy. Let&#39;s continue are discussion about redundancy in the layer two environment. To review what STP does (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Spanning Tree Protocol&#34;&gt;Spanning Tree Protocol&lt;/a&gt;) it works at layer two of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; title=&#34;OSI model&#34;&gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt;. If more than one path is available in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Network Layer&#34;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; the STP algorithm basically shutdowns the redundant links until the active link is unavailable (shutdown, disabled, etc.) So although there are multiple links connected physically to offer redundancy, logically the switches in the network only see one path that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame&#34; title=&#34;Ethernet frame&#34;&gt;Ethernet frame&lt;/a&gt; can travel. Remember without STP networks would be on the fritz when we introduce redundancy in the environment. STP or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1D&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.1D&#34;&gt;IEEE 802.1D&lt;/a&gt; is an open standard so it is not just on Cisco equipment but others as well which helps in a multivendor situation. So how does looping occur without the use STP? Looking at the picture below we can see the broadcasts frames are flooding the network which is by design but the thing that changes is these broadcasts will continue to flood the network because there is on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live&#34; title=&#34;Time to live&#34;&gt;TTL&lt;/a&gt; (Time-To-Live) on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Link_Layer&#34; title=&#34;Data Link Layer&#34;&gt;data link layer&lt;/a&gt; of the OSI model. As more packets are passed and created the network will become slower and slower and eventually devices on the network will become unavailable this called a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_radiation&#34; title=&#34;Broadcast radiation&#34;&gt;broadcast storm&lt;/a&gt;. [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1534&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;584&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;STP Loop Example (Broadcast Storm)&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stpfl.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stpfl.png&#34; alt=&#34;An example of an STP loop&#34; title=&#34;STP Loop&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] There are also more problems when not using STP besides broadcast storms like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; table becoming unstable in each switch. This causes the MAC table to be unreliable because of the looping frames in the network. These frames are usually sent to the wrong locations in the network. Multiple frames can also be a problem because of looping frames multiple frames appear on the network and if they are delivered to the intended host it can confuse the host and more likly drop the frames. So looking at the same picture but with STP enabled we can see that broadcast frame will travel the network without looping. On S1 one of the ports is in a blocking state and blocks all traffic coming into that port and traffic coming out of that port. [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1539&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;584&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;STP Enabled&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/09/07/the-middle-of-layer-two-redundancy/stp-enable/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/stp-enable.png&#34; alt=&#34;STP Enabled&#34; title=&#34;STP Enable&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] The magic about STP is when the link between S2 and S3 becomes disconnected it will bring the link between S2 and S1 online and continue to send packets! When the link becomes available again it switch back to blocking on S1. So let&#39;s stop there for now and check back next week to see the last chapter of STP, how does it calculate which switch goes to blocking? What other advantages does STP offer? That&#39;s all next week, I hope this information is helpful and if you have an idea of the next topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me hear it!&lt;/p&gt;
