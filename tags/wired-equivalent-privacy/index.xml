          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/wirelesssecurity.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://systemstechblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/wirelesssecurity.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Wireless-Security-Icon&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although having a wireless LAN sounds like a wonderful idea, there are things that need to be implemented like security. A wireless LAN can be uncontrollable has it is just radio waves and anybody can receive them. Having and using good security practices can help you be under control of your wireless LAN.  Not having any security in a wireless LAN environment will cause anybody to have access to the network. Some threats that lead to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Wireless LAN&#34;&gt;wireless LANs&lt;/a&gt; can be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War Drivers – These are people who &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; around to find open networks that are not secure and looking for free internet access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackers – These types of people usually have malicious ideas in mind; this can be anything to entering unauthorized systems and stealing data or even harming the physical system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees –Although we may have an excellent defense on the outside of our network, we sometimes forget that the inside of our network needs to be secure as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original 802.11 standard there were two types of authentication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open authentication, which as the name implies has no authentication and will allow anybody to use the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared authentication, which used &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy&#34; title=&#34;Wired Equivalent Privacy&#34;&gt;WEP&lt;/a&gt; and is now flawed, The WEP algorithm was weak and WEP was also not very scalable. (See post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/14/cracking-wep/&#34; title=&#34;Cracking WEP&#34;&gt;Cracking WEP&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are two enterprise-level encryption methods which are specified in the 802.11i and are certified as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access&#34; title=&#34;Wi-Fi Protected Access&#34;&gt;WPA&lt;/a&gt; and WPA2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Key_Integrity_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Temporal Key Integrity Protocol&#34;&gt;TKIP&lt;/a&gt; is an encryption method certified has WPA, TKIP supports for legacy WLAN equipment by fixing the flaws with the original 802.11 WEP encryption. TKIP encrypts at the layer 2 (Data Link) payloads and carries a message of integrity check (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code&#34; title=&#34;Message authentication code&#34;&gt;Message Integrity Check&lt;/a&gt;) in the encrypted packet. This helps to make sure the message or packet was not tampered with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AES is an encryption method certified has WPA2, AES has the same functions as TKIP but does use additional data from the MAC header to recognize if the data has been tampered with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some steps to check when setting up a wireless LAN is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the wired network, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol&#34; title=&#34;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol&#34;&gt;DHCP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access&#34; title=&#34;Internet access&#34;&gt;Internet access&lt;/a&gt; before setting up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point&#34; title=&#34;Wireless access point&#34;&gt;wireless access point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next install the access point but by keeping it away from devices that could case greater interference .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29&#34; title=&#34;Service set (802.11 network)&#34;&gt;SSID&lt;/a&gt; on the access point. Don&#39;t put security on the access point yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure or install one or two wireless clients. Don&#39;t put security on these devices yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify wireless network operation within the clients. Check to make sure you can get access to network resources and outside the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_security&#34; title=&#34;Wireless security&#34;&gt;wireless security&lt;/a&gt;. Such as WPA2 with PSK .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify network operation again to make sure that the wireless clients can get access to network resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now that&#39;s my summary for the basic wireless security, this really goes over the concepts but not the configuration. There are a lot of online guides that can go into the configuration aspect of the wireless client and the access point. Like always I hope this information was informative and if you come up with any other ideas that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me know by posting a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cracking WEP</title>

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackTrack&#34; title=&#34;BackTrack&#34;&gt;BackTrack&lt;/a&gt; is Linux  &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security&#34; title=&#34;Network security&#34;&gt;network security&lt;/a&gt; audit tool for security professionals. This tool is used for testing and penetrating networks. That being said** This tutorial is for educational use only. This is meant only to teach that WEP is an insecure option, and is recommend to use a harder encryption. Using this tutorial on a network that you do not have permission to access or is not yours, could be illegal! ** This was tested on BackTrack version 4 and the steps outlined in this tutorial were successful. (this tutorial is assuming that you have BackTrack 4 installed and are ready with a shell prompt)  The first thing you want to do is start your wireless interface in most cases this is wlan0 [code]airmon-ng start wlan0[/code] In the output look for the monitor interface in most cases this is mon0   The next thing you want to do is copy down the target AP&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29&#34; title=&#34;Service set (802.11 network)&#34;&gt;ESSID&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address&#34; title=&#34;MAC address&#34;&gt;MAC address&lt;/a&gt; of the AP,  also copy down the channel of the target AP.  [code]airodump-ng mon0[/code] There must be a client or clients using the AP if not you can&#39;t crack it. Match the MAC address of the AP to the available clients you have listed.   Next only output what you want (for example I have an AP on channel 8 and that MAC address of the AP is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and it&#39;s out monitor 0) the command would be:       [code]airodump-ng --channel 8 --write output --bssid 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 mon0[/code] (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is you want to associate your wireless card with the AP(for example I have the AP&#39;s MAC and ESSID (which is test) and my wireless MAC address (which is aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -1 0 -e test -a 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is start the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_injection&#34; title=&#34;Packet injection&#34;&gt;packet injection&lt;/a&gt; (for example you will need the target AP&#39;s MAC address (which is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and my(yours) wireless MAC address (which is 00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like:       [code]aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h 00:55:bb:DD:FF mon0[/code]   (Open a new shell prompt) The final step depends were the outputs are saved and the name of the output (for this example they were on /root and the name of the file was output-01.cap) so the command would look like:     [code]aircrack-ng output-01.cap[/code] Again this depends were the file was saved it could be in a different location. But after that command aircrack will attempt to crack the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy&#34; title=&#34;Wired Equivalent Privacy&#34;&gt;WEP key&lt;/a&gt; it will tell you that it either failed or if it was able to find it. (If it does fail wait for more packets and try again.)   The way aircrack works is that it reads the packet injection file, (this file is continues to update as packets move across the network) aircrack then finds the common key because that key is sent back and forth in the network. Depending on how active the network is aircrack is able to find the key in less than a minute!   Keep in mind when I was setting this up on a test AP I did run into some difficulties, although cracking a WEP key is relatively easy it still took me some time in troubleshooting. I hope this tutorial is helpful, you can find more information at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&lt;/a&gt; Also check my tutorial on &lt;a href=&#34;http://systemstechblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/&#34; title=&#34;Install BackTrack&#34;&gt;Installing BackTrack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
