            Well..couple of things have changed these past months that have had a lasting impact on everyone on this earth. A single reminder that we all share a common home on this place, even though we sometimes think were world&#39;s apart from each other.
During this time I&#39;ve been working from home, and busier then ever making sure the lights stay on. I like to think of myself as a lighthouse keeper or some type of engineer maintaining a spacecraft floating in space sending &amp;quot;pings&amp;quot; waiting for reply.

            Every year I think about goals, either how to conquer them, reflect on them, and recently change them. We all have been there, we have a plan in our head that we follow for a handful of years or even decades... something happens... all of sudden things change. It&#39;s this change that I believe is so important to life, we can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be static, we have to change in order to grow ourselves.
