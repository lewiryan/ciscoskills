          &lt;p&gt;On this Monday let&#39;s wrap up the 802.11 wireless standards, Friday I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11g-2003&#34;&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt; (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/08/802-11g/&#34; title=&#34;802.11g&#34;&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt;) and before that I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11b-1999&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/07/802-11b/&#34; title=&#34;802.11b&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; ) I also talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11a-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11a-1999&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;, (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/06/802-11a/&#34; title=&#34;802.11a&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;) I even talked about the 802.11 –Legacy (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/05/802-11-legacy/&#34; title=&#34;802.11 -Legacy&#34;&gt;802.11 –Legacy&lt;/a&gt;) and in the beginning of last week I talked about the basic wireless concepts. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) So let&#39;s end the discussion and talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11n-2009&#34;&gt;802.11n&lt;/a&gt; standard! You could say that the 802.11n standard is the best of both worlds in the 802.11 wireless standards. 802.11n was officially released in October of 2009 and can run in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz&lt;/a&gt; range and use the 5GHz range. Something that is special in the 802.11n standard is the use of multiple-input multiple-output (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO&#34; title=&#34;MIMO&#34;&gt;MIMO&lt;/a&gt;). MIMO is a technology which uses multiple antennas to gather more information essentially. It uses SDM Spatial Division Multiplexing to significantly increase the data throughput. Because of this technology 802.11n can in theory transfer speeds up to 300 &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units&#34; title=&#34;Data rate units&#34;&gt;Mbps&lt;/a&gt;. 802.11n is also backwards compatible like the 802.11g standard it can also work with the 802.11b standard. 802.11n can also work with the 802.11a standard in the 5GHz range. Currently 802.11n is the fastest and has the longest range compared to the earlier 802.11 standards. 802.11n indoors has a range of about 230 feet, in outdoor environments the 802.11n has range of about 800 feet. We all know technology changes and a while ago I posted about the 802.11ac standard which does have the potential to travel in speeds up to 1Gbps! (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/21/802-11ac-standard/&#34; title=&#34;802.11ac Standard&#34;&gt;802.11ac Standard&lt;/a&gt;) For now that&#39;s my summary version of the 802.11n standard, like always I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday I talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11b-1999&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt; (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/07/802-11b/&#34; title=&#34;802.11b&#34;&gt;802.11b&lt;/a&gt;), and before that I talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11a-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11a-1999&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;,(See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/06/802-11a/&#34; title=&#34;802.11a&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;) I even talked about the 802.11 –Legacy (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/05/802-11-legacy/&#34; title=&#34;802.11 -Legacy&#34;&gt;802.11 –Legacy&lt;/a&gt;) and in the beginning of the week I talked about the basic wireless concepts. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Standards&lt;/a&gt;) So on this Friday let&#39;s talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11g-2003&#34;&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt; standard! The 802.11g standard was ratified in June of 2003, and like 802.11b it operates in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz&lt;/a&gt; range. Also just like the 802.11b standard other devices that run in 2.4GHz range like cordless phones, microwaves can cause interference with the wireless signal. The 802.11g can work in two encoding classes, the Direct Sequence Spectrum (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Direct-sequence spread spectrum&#34;&gt;DSSS&lt;/a&gt;) which is like the 802.11b standard it does have benefits of resistance to jamming, you could share the signal channel among other users, it reduced the signal and noise level which helped in interception. In addition to DSSS the 802.11g standard can also use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing&#34; title=&#34;Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing&#34;&gt;Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing&lt;/a&gt; (OFDM) which does have an advantage to still operate under severe channel conditions, like attenuation, and interference. The maximum data rate in theory is 54 Mbit/s  this speed is exactly what the 802.11a standard gets. Another benefit of the 802.11g is the fact it is backwards compatible to the 802.11b standard. So in your wireless network you could have a mix of wireless standards 802.11b and 802.11g. However this does add some latency in your network and can slow it down. Because the 802.11g is backwards compatible the standard was rapidly adopted by manufactures and consumers. But this does have its drawbacks because like the 802.11b standard, 802.11g only has three channels that don&#39;t overlap and it is best practice not to have these channels overlap. That&#39;s it for this summary of the 802.11g standard, check back on Monday and I&#39;ll have the 802.11n standard posted. Like always I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/h2&gt;

Yesterday&#39;s post we talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11a-1999&#34; title=&#34;IEEE 802.11a-1999&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt; standard. (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/06/802-11a/&#34; title=&#34;802.11a&#34;&gt;802.11a&lt;/a&gt;) We also we talked about the 802.11 – Legacy standard (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/05/802-11-legacy/&#34; title=&#34;802.11 - Legacy&#34;&gt;802.11 – Legacy&lt;/a&gt;) and in the beginning of the week I went over some Basic &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN&#34; title=&#34;Wireless LAN&#34;&gt;Wireless&lt;/a&gt; Concepts (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) So now that we are up to speed lets learn about the 802.11b standard. The 802.11b standard was developed the same time 802.11a went out, which was in 1999. Some key differences are that 802.11b works in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz&lt;/a&gt; range and only has a maximum bandwidth of 11 (Mbit/s). Along with only using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum&#34; title=&#34;Direct-sequence spread spectrum&#34;&gt;Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; (DSSS) Like in the 802.11 – Legacy the DSSS had the benefits of Resistance to jamming, you could share the signal channel among other users, it reduced the signal and noise level which helped in interception. Since the 802.11b standard is in the 2.4GHz range there are only three out of the eleven channels that don&#39;t overlap. Also remember that there are other devices that use the 2.4GHz range so 802.11b devices can suffer interference from other products, like cordless phones, microwaves, etc. 802.11b products were on the market pretty quickly in early 2000 because of the cheap material to make them and the wide acceptance of the product/standard. That&#39;s it for today, check back tomorrow and I&#39;ll be posting about the 802.11g standard. Like before I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/h2&gt;

On Monday I talked about the Basic Wireless Concepts (See the post &lt;a href=&#34;http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/04/basic-wireless-concepts/&#34; title=&#34;Basic Wireless Concepts&#34;&gt;Basic Wireless Concepts&lt;/a&gt;) in that post I mentioned the wireless standards but did not go further into detail. This post will be going over the second standard 802.11a out of the five standards that make up the 802.11. The 802.11a was published in 1999 and operates in the 5GHz band instead of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&#34; title=&#34;ISM band&#34;&gt;2.4GHz band&lt;/a&gt; because of this 802.11a uses only the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing&#34; title=&#34;Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing&#34;&gt;Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing&lt;/a&gt; (OFDM) which does have an advantage to still operate under severe channel conditions, like attenuation, and interference. The 802.11a in theory has maximum raw data rate of 54Mbit/s however because of the varied conditions you should expect 802.11a to have a maximum speed around 20Mbit/s. What is different between the 802.11a and other 802.11 standards is the fact that the 802.11a standard has 12 channels that are not overlapping each other. Since the 802.11a standard only operates in the 5GHz band it does not get has much interference compared to the 2.4GHz range. That&#39;s it for this summary for the 802.11a standard. Check back tomorrow and I&#39;ll be posting the 802.11b standard. I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.&lt;/h2&gt;
