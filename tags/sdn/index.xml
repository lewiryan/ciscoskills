            I still consider myself a rookie in this field even though I started my &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; career in the Network/IT space 5 years ago. Why is that? Is part of the reason because of the rapid push that applications are demanding from the infrastructure? For example if we want XYZ app to be ready for testing today and production in a week how would you be able to stand that up manually?
