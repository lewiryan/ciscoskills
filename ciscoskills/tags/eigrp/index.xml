            From its older brother IGRP which was developed in 1980s to overcome the limitations of RIP, EIGRP was an &amp;quot;Enhanced&amp;quot; IGRP protocol. The main purpose of EIGRP was toÂ overcome the limitations of classful networks and make EIGRP a classless routing protocol. During designing of this protocol a different convergence algorithm was used making EIGRP that &amp;quot;hybrid&amp;quot; between distance-vector and link-state routing protocols. In this post we&#39;ll go over a basic design and setup for EIGRP, however instead of using the &amp;quot;classic way&amp;quot; let&#39;s look at configuring EIGRP using named mode which is available in Cisco IOS starting in version 15.
