            Changing topics for today, I want to talk about the Windows 8 Developer Preview which was released on September 13th. I had the time to install it under virtual box and was pleasantly surprised! About how fast it installed the easy to understand install prompts and the new &amp;quot;Metro&amp;quot; UI which is aimed at touched devices. Also the ability to switch to the standard Windows operating system. This is an alpha build so it&#39;s not even on at the beta stages yet,Â Take a look for yourself!
