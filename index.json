I think were getting close in seeing an ending, but everyone's life has been affected by this. My work/home life has changed. My priorities have shifted, and because of that this website is going to go static for a while with an unknown date of return. It's time for change.\nThere is content from 2011 all the way to 2021 on this site. During those years you can tell my writing style has changed and the amount of posts I did throughout the years. The way I introduce topics, I start to get more personal instead of a tutorial style post, all of it a learning experience for me. My original goal for this site was to just to get better at my writing skills. To be able to explain something technical with words and try to keep it easy to understand, which is sometimes impossible with technology.\nOver the years I have grown professionally with this site being the backbone of it, in 2011 I graduated college and was hired as a Network Engineer! My first \u0026quot;real\u0026quot; job into a career of opportunities which I took this site along the way. It's got some history in here!\nThis site was also something else for me, during these years my personal life has changed or maybe a better way to say it and being honest is this site was an escape for me, I was ignoring everything around me including questions I didn't want to answer about myself, and my life.\nIt worked for the most part all the way through 2019, I was sitting down on the grass during lunch with a close friend a couple summers ago, I knew this person for three years at the time, and still close friends to this day. Normally we talked about a lot of things in the past but this more, something was different. We talked for hours about life, goals, and relationships. This person opened up to me about the their life, their story, their struggles and it was tipping point for me. I realized right then I had choice to make, I could really open up to this friend like they did to me and tell them my story. Tell them who I am, they would be the first person to know this about me, Do I take that chance with someone? Should I just ignore it, change the subject and escape into some other topic? That spilt-multi-second decision changed my life and I'll always remember it.\nIn short, don't escape into something and not answer the hard questions you're ignoring. Be proud of who you are, be grateful to the friends, relationships and family that you have, and don't be afraid if you're going against the grain. That is what makes all the difference!\nI'm planning on continuing to write probably on a different URL but feel free to follow @lewiryan or this site as one one day I'll post something about it! Thank you for reading this and using this site as a reference, it's truly been wonderful and life growing experience for me!\nUpdate: It is official this site is now static! Over the past months I have been moving this site to its forever home and I got to say I'm impressed with the static website generator called Hugo! Although it has been a manual process and it's still ongoing there is going to content that is not been cleaned but I'm getting there and will put out another update! I am so grateful that I did this, Going over each these posts is a reflection for me and a reminder of posts I remember doing, others I don’t at all! Also, during this migration, I have changed some content and tweaked some posts by mostly added photos and a little grammar help along the way. So it's \u0026quot;technically\u0026quot; not static yet but the foundation is there!\nThis site will probably mean more to me than it does for you, but it’s been part of my life and I don't want to just dump it and forget about it. Read the first 10 years of my adult life, towards the end of the decade a more personal Ryan comes out...and like always I hope this is helpful!\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2021/01/03/ten-years/","section":"post","tags":["LGBT","life","personal"],"title":"Ten Years"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/aws/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"AWS"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/bgp/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"BGP"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ecmp/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ECMP"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/fortigate/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Fortigate"},{"body":"It's like clock work...around this time the seasons are changing..autumn colors are out, and the colder air reminds us that things are changing around here, embrace it! One thing that I've been working with is AWS Transit gateways, a common theme this year is all cloud! AWS Transit Gateways make it easier to move towards that!\nAWS Transit gateways relatively new, (couple years old now) so instead of attaching to each AWS VPC environment independently we can connect to the transit gateway and attach VPCs to the gateway. If you enable BGP your routes will propagate. I've been working with ECMP, specifically with Fortigates.\nThere are two ways to have redundancy in a network when you have multiple paths to a destination. Similar routes that have a higher cost/weight then ones that don't are only used when there is a problem with primary path. So you have a backup route on standby until the primary route fails. This could be a good option if the backup route isn't the same bandwidth/media or really not equal to the primary link which is why different cost/weight is important to have.\nHowever if you have multiple paths that were equal bandwidth/media we could/would want to use both of them at the same time so that traffic is load balanced across the network, this is called ECMP (Equal-cost multi-path routing)\nLet's walk though the steps on how to setup ECMP on a Fortigate using BGP. I'm already guessing you have an AWS account with an AWS transit gateway deployed that supports ECMP, as well as configured your customer gateway in AWS with BGP Autonomous system (AS) number.\nIn this example I have a Fortigate Firewall running version 6.4.2, I have set the BGP \u0026quot;AS\u0026quot; number to 65000 and the AWS \u0026quot;AS\u0026quot; number is 64512.\nAmazon gives you a text file to download the configuration for these two tunnels but depending on your Fortigate setup we may have to tweak the file, (not a good idea to just paste it) In this example here is what I have for tunnel one:\n1# Configure Phase 1 of the tunnel, aka IKE 2config vpn ipsec phase1-interface 3edit \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-1\u0026#34; 4set dpd on-idle 5 6# Outside Interface to reach AWS 7set interface outside 8 9# External IP address using (RFC 5737) in this example 10set local-gw 198.51.100.1 11set dhgrp 2 12set proposal aes128-sha1 13set keylife 28800 14 15# Remote Peer this is AWS Transit, using (RFC 5737) in example` 16set remote-gw 192.0.2.124 17set psksecret ciscoskills.net 18set dpd-retryinterval 10 19next 20end 21 22# Configure Phase 2 of the Tunnel, aka IPSEC 23config vpn ipsec phase2-interface 24edit \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-1\u0026#34; 25set phase1name \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-1\u0026#34; 26set proposal aes128-sha1 27set dhgrp 2 28set pfs enable 29set keylifeseconds 3600 30end 31 32# Build the tunnel interface 33config system interface 34edit \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-1\u0026#34; 35set vdom \u0026#34;root\u0026#34; 36set ip 169.254.150.142 255.255.255.255 37set allowaccess ping 38set type tunnel 39set tcp-mss 1379 40set remote-ip 169.254.150.141/32 41set mtu enable 42set mtu 1427 43set interface \u0026#34;outside\u0026#34; 44next 45end After the tunnel one is created, AWS gives us configuration for the second tunnel, basically the same configuration with some differences, here is tunnel two.\n1# Configure Phase 1 of the tunnel, aka IKE 2 3config vpn ipsec phase1-interface 4edit \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-2\u0026#34; 5set dpd on-idle 6# Outside Interface to reach AWS 7set interface outside 8# External IP address using (RFC 5737) in this example 9set local-gw 198.51.100.1 10set dhgrp 2 11set proposal aes128-sha1 12set keylife 28800 13# Remote Peer this is AWS Transit, using (RFC 5737) in example 14set remote-gw 203.0.113.25 15set psksecret ciscoskills.com 16set dpd-retryinterval 10 17next 18end 19 20# Configure Phase 2 of the Tunnel, aka IPSEC 21 22config vpn ipsec phase2-interface 23edit \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-2\u0026#34; 24set phase1name \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-2\u0026#34; 25set proposal aes128-sha1 26set dhgrp 2 27set pfs enable 28set keylifeseconds 3600 29end 30 31# Build the tunnel interface 32config system interface 33edit \u0026#34;AWS-0615bcc6f-2\u0026#34; 34set vdom \u0026#34;root\u0026#34; 35set ip 169.254.157.90 255.255.255.255 36set allowaccess ping 37set type tunnel 38set tcp-mss 1379 39set remote-ip 169.254.157.89/32 40set mtu enable 41set mtu 1427 42set interface \u0026#34;outside\u0026#34; 43next 44end We now have two tunnels configured, these won't show online until the Fortigate has a policy attached to them. So you could put firewall rules on each tunnel interface or better yet is to create a zone within the Fortigate and add the two tunnel interfaces into same zone. By creating a zone within Fortigate the same firewall rules apply to each interface instead of creating/copying rules to each tunnel interface. (This would be an example)\n1config system zone 2edit AWS-0615bcc6f 3set interface AWS-0615bcc6f-1 4set interface AWS-0615bcc6f-2 5set intrazone allow 6next 7end Once those interfaces are either in a zone and in a Firewall policy you should be able to bring those tunnel interfaces online. The final thing is configure our Fortigate with BGP so that when you attach a VPC to the transit gateway that IP space gets advertised automatically. We also want to enable ECMP with BGP.\n1# Enable BGP on the Fortigate 2 3config router bgp 4# This is the number we set in AWS, so it should match what TG has 5set as 65000 6set router-id `198.51.100.1` 7 8# Since we are using \u0026#34;AS\u0026#34; Numbers, we tell the Fortigate to use 9# External Multipath with out it BGP will use one route at time 10# Active/Passive 11 12set ebgp-multipath enable 13config neighbor 14edit \u0026#34;169.254.157.89\u0026#34; 15set remote-as 64512 16next 17edit \u0026#34;169.254.150.141\u0026#34; 18set remote-as 64512 19next 20end If we attached a VPC to the transit gateway, and in this example I attached a VPC range of 10.0.0.0/16 to the transit gateway. That IP range would show up in the Fortigate, if we look at the routing table via get router info routing-table all\n1FW01 # get router info routing-table all 2Codes: K - kernel, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, B - BGP 3O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 4N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 5E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 6i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area 7- candidate default 8 9Routing table for VRF=0 10S* 0.0.0.0/0 [5/0] via `198.51.100.`25, ppp1 11B 10.0.0.0/16 [20/100] via 169.254.150.141, AWS-0615bcc6f-1, 03:07:57 12 [20/100] via 169.254.157.89, AWS-0615bcc6f-2, 03:07:57 13C `198.51.100.1`/32 is directly connected, ppp1 14C 169.254.150.141/32 is directly connected, AWS-0615bcc6f-1 15C 169.254.150.142/32 is directly connected, AWS-0615bcc6f-1 16C 169.254.157.89/32 is directly connected, AWS-0615bcc6f-2 17C 169.254.157.90/32 is directly connected, AWS-0615bcc6f-2 We can see that 10.0.0.0/16 is available to us via the VPN interfaces, we have equal paths as well, traffic will load balance between each tunnel interface. BGP with ECMP is alive and active! ... That's all I got for this post, like always I hope this information is helpful, got questions?

I like to call it the loop, we get so caught into repetition...its our comfort when things are predictable but when something comes along and changes our lives, good or bad we have to adapt to those changes and potentially change our life direction.\nEarlier in January and last year I recognized my personal life had been the status quo for way too long. I talked about Goals. I started to think about where do I see my personal life in five, ten, twenty years from now? What about my professional life?\nAt a younger age while I still in high school I knew what my professional life was going to look like. I always loved technology and so I made goal, even though I may not known exactly how I would get there but I jumped feet first into it. Taking college courses in high school in the field that I'm in today. It's one thing the education system always reminded me, \u0026quot;think about your future, your career\u0026quot;. All important for a teenager to think about but it consumed me...throughout the remaining years in high school and in college its what I was focused on..my professional life, all the while leaving my personal life behind.\nNot to say that someone shouldn't be focused on their career and education but I had questions about my personal life that I really didn't want to figure out while I was in high school or college. I kind of thought while I was focused on my professional life, my personal life would just fall into place. Nine years later I was doing well professionally, one of the reasons I started this blog was to be focused professionally. However my personal life was a nonexistent.\nIt seemed like my life was hitting a ceiling and I would only break though if I figured out my personal paradigm. I had choice really, either stay with how things stand and have everything be predictable, or answer those internal questions about myself and be comfortable with the fact that I may not know where this personal life journey may take me.\nI've realized that although I teat my professional and personal life as two different paradigms, those paradigms are revolving around me. What actions in either of them affects me as a person as well as the paradigms themselves. When I look my at professional life I don't think I've hit that ceiling yet, but acknowledgement that someday I will have to answer those questions again... like I did high school and be comfortable with the possibility of not knowing exactly were my professional life journey takes me.\n\u0026quot;We become what we think about\u0026quot;\n- Earl Nightingale\nLife is always changing and so making adjustments to our paradigms multiple times to re-evaluate our life circumstances is what everyone should be doing throughout their life. Hopefully helping us ask those questions where do I see myself five, ten, twenty years from now? What's important to me, the people I care about, the people I love? Most of the time you can't answer these right away, in time having these questions around you make you aware of who you really want to be.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2020/08/15/its-always-changing/","section":"post","tags":["goals","inspirational","life"],"title":"It's Always Changing"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/asa/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ASA"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"cisco"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco-asa/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cisco ASA"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/vti/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"VTI"},{"body":"I've been stuck in more ways then one this year...working from home indefinitely seems to be the status quo right now, and I'm in \u0026quot;tunnel\u0026quot; mode for most part. Most of these projects I'm working on all of common theme.. connect on-premise to more cloud resources! One way to do that is using VTIs. (Virtual Tunnel Interfaces) VTIs which are not new...been around for a bit, Cisco IOS had the feature available like 10+ years ago! We only got introduced into this technology with ASA when version 9.7 (2017) and above arrived....\nIn the old days, which wasn't that long ago.... We were stuck with cryptomaps to interfaces and dealing with \u0026quot;interesting\u0026quot; traffic when working with ASAs...Well time for change no more defining interesting traffic, we route these bits instead! Any traffic we want to go over the tunnel is routed over, we can apply ACLs on the inbound interface just like we do with physical interfaces, so simple...\nHere is the topology I'm working with:\nThis is a pretty standard setup, basically we have two sites and want a tunnel between them. We can setup a VTI Tunnel and route via the next hop address. You can also run a routing protocol over this so this can scale out easy.\nIn this example I got two Cisco ASAs using version 9.12(2), just like the old days, things have to match in order to get a tunnel up. In this example I'm using IKEv2 this policy has to match on both ends:\n1crypto ikev2 policy 1 2 encryption 3des 3 integrity sha 4 group 2 5 prf sha 6 lifetime seconds 86400 :!: Please use a higher encryption than what I have, this is just for demonstration. :) I also found out that NIST will not allow 3DES starting in 2024.

(preshared keys have to match) In this example I'm using local and remote keys, just like you would expect remote key would match the local key on the remote end, and vise versa.\n1tunnel-group 203.0.113.2 type ipsec-l2l 2tunnel-group 203.0.113.2 general-attributes 3 default-group-policy P2P-VPN 4tunnel-group 203.0.113.2 ipsec-attributes 5 ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key ***** 6 ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-key ***** On site two we do the same thing, flipping the IP addresses.\n1tunnel-group 198.51.100.2 type ipsec-l2l 2tunnel-group 198.51.100.2 general-attributes 3 default-group-policy P2P-VPN 4tunnel-group 198.51.100.2 ipsec-attributes 5 ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key ***** 6 ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-key ***** Tunnel is created but in order to bring it up and use we need to create VTI interface on the ASA's. Here is how site one looks for the the tunnel interface.

We have remote backups working but we never needed them...\nJust like how the season changes so do our IP addresses, nothing is ever static. Now we are faced with a problem... We have to move this perfectly operational system, that hasn't bothered anyone. Our fear is now realized everything works now, what is going to happen when we change the IP address of this thing? Flashbacks from Reddit posts, re-imaging, downtime, everything is down! Remember we were the lucky guys, our FMCv just worked out the box no issues! Are we going to stir the hornet nest? Well I can tell you changing the IP address of the FMCv is as simple as running this script in CLI:\n1sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/configure-network It's that easy...(almost too easy) I had to move the VMDK of this thing to a different vSphere install as well as in a different data center. So I just cloned the original moved the clone and turned it on, ran the CLI script and in about 15 minutes all of my devices checked in automatically.\nRemember you have to make sure you can reach your devices from your different IP scheme. After that its been back to a smooth road like nothing ever happened, policies are pushed correctly, IPS rules are updated correctly, URL filtering works, upgrades work out of the box, and backups are working! The only thing that has changed is the IP address, just the season! These are the always the best stories to tell!\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2019/10/01/fmcv-change-ip-address/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","cisco","FMC","Internet","technology"],"title":"FMCv - Change IP Address"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/internet/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Internet"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/elasticsearch/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Elasticsearch"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/graylog/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"graylog"},{"body":"Graylog has been through some changes last time I talked about them, hitting version 3.0 in February is awesome and one of things that make Graylog run well is Elasticsearch backend. Although Elasticsearch is not too hard to setup it usually runs better on bare metal, so there is cost of that as well as maintenance of the cluster is important, updates and upgrades. Depending your team experience you may not have time to learn it or run it the way it should be. That last thing you want is your logging setup to go down because of poor maintenance. So in this post we will walk though setting up a Graylog Server and using AWS Elasticsearch service for our backend. Without having a quick Elasticsearch cluster Graylog experience suffers, so let's get started.\nThe first thing and easiest thing is to spin up an Elasticsearch cluster within AWS. Depending on your use case you may only want a development deployment (single-node) or you can do a 3 or 2 node cluster within different availability zones within AWS, so its up to you and your wallet ;) of how big or small you want this Elasticsearch resource.\nAdditional security protections are recommended if this going to be used for production, like one example is don't open Elasticsearch to the internet without ACLs in place!\nIf you want more information about Elasticsearch service that AWS provides go ahead and read AWS Developer Guide - Amazon Elasticsearch Service.\nOnce your cluster is up and running, keep note of the Endpoint URL you will need that for Graylog. In this example I'm using Centos 7 for the Graylog Server and depending on the operating system you are using for the Graylog server follow the instructions on Graylog's Read the Docs.\nNo need for me to repeat installation steps, in this example I'm using Centos 7 and followed the documentation. Since we have an Elasticsearch cluster provided by AWS you don't need to anything related to Elasticsearch when installing Graylog, so skip it. Once you have Graylog installed go ahead and start it up to make sure you get the webpage and can login. This just verifies you have a working Graylog server ready to go. You might see some errors related to indexing but that is expected, we have not told Graylog about our AWS Elasticsearch resource. Login into your Graylog server and with your favorite text editor open the Graylog server configuration file /etc/graylog/server/server.conf We are looking to modify the Elasticsearch hosts by default its local host to the Endpoint URL that is in your AWS Elasticsearch resource.\n1# List of Elasticsearch hosts Graylog should connect to. 2# Need to be specified as a comma-separated list of valid URIs for the http ports of your elasticsearch nodes. 3# If one or more of your elasticsearch hosts require authentication, include the credentials in each node URI that 4# requires authentication. 5# 6# Default: http://127.0.0.1:9200 7elasticsearch\\_hosts = https://search-24726754557.us-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/ Restart the Graylog server service\n1systemctl restart graylog-server You now have Graylog server backed by an AWS Elasticsearch Cluster, log away :) AWS makes deploying Graylog even easier if you don't want to have your own Elasticsearch cluster. Although you can't stop the AWS ES Cluster you can snapshot the data to an S3 bucket and import it back into a new ES cluster and connect Graylog back to it. This makes it so you don't have this running 24x7, maybe useful for temporary debugging logs or run it 24x7. Well that's all I got for a Friday, and its the first day of summer \u0026quot;officially\u0026quot; so time enjoy it! I do hope this information is helpful but also enjoy your summer! 8-)\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2019/06/21/graylog-with-aws-elasticsearch/","section":"post","tags":["AWS","Elasticsearch","graylog","Open source","Software","technology"],"title":"Graylog with AWS Elasticsearch"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/open-source/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Open source"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/software/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Software"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/certification/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Certification"},{"body":"Well we finally got an answer, Cisco is upping their Certifications and making some big changes.

Well there are two different types interface ports on these type of switches. SVIs (Switched Virtual Interface) and \u0026quot;routed\u0026quot; ports, fundamentally they are same and clients/users wouldn't be able to tell if you were using/going through an SVI or a \u0026quot;routed\u0026quot; port. However they are different and in this post we'll talk about these two and when and were it would be recommended to place an SVI or a routed port.\nIn order to pass traffic between networks we need a router. Switches work in layer two and routers work in layer three, this separation of duties between devices works well. Doing something like Configuring Router on Stick, is easier to troubleshoot and usually cheaper to implement. It only becomes a problem when we run out of resources like bandwidth.\nLooking on the example below, we have three different networks all branching off of this router. The router has three networks configured on this interface the red network, teal network and the blue network. In order for PC1 to reach PC2 it has use the router even through they are plugged on the same switch, they are on different VLANs, different networks. If PC1 was transferring a lot of data between PC2 it could easily tap out that router's interface. Other devices on those networks like PC3 would become bandwidth starved and struggle to get a good connection for inter-vlan connectivity. However a multilayered switch which has usually plenty of bandwidth on its back plane and would be able to handle this easily and in this example this would be great use case to create and SVI interface for each network. To create an SVI:\nWe have to have a VLAN created first, in this example lets use 105.\n1switch(config)# vlan 105 2switch(config-vlan)# name RED-NETWORK 3switch(config-vlan)# exit switch(config)# We then create an interface VLAN, referencing the VLAN we created in step one and apply an IP address and subnet mask on VLAN interface.\n1switch(config)# interface vlan 105 2switch(config-if)# ip address 192.168.150.1 255.255.255.0 3switch(config-if)# no shutdown 4switch(config-if)# exit On the interfaces that belong to that VLAN in this example PC1 apply the VLAN and verify the interface is in switchport mode.\n1switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/1 2switch(config-if)# switchport 3switch(config-if)# switchport mode access 4switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 105 5switch(config-if)# no shutdown 6switch(config-if)# exit Here is the configuration for the TEAL Network, if we wanted to configure the BLUE network just put it into a different VLAN and separate IP network.\n1switch(config)# vlan 110 2switch(config-vlan)# name TEAL-NETWORK 3switch(config-vlan)# exit 4switch(config)# interface vlan 110 5switch(config-if)# ip address 192.168.160.1 255.255.255.0 6switch(config-if)# no shutdown 7switch(config-if)# exit 8switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/2 9switch(config-if)# switchport 10switch(config-if)# switchport mode access 11switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 110 12switch(config-if)# exit We can then verify that the switch has a routing table by issuing show ip route and if we also run the command show ip interface brief and you can see the interface-vlans\n1switch# show ip route 2IP Route Table for VRF \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; 3\u0026#39;*\u0026#39; denotes best ucast next-hop 4\u0026#39;**\u0026#39; denotes best mcast next-hop 5\u0026#39;[x/y]\u0026#39; denotes [preference/metric] 6\u0026#39;%\u0026#39; in via output denotes VRF 7 8192.168.150.0/24, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached 9*via 192.168.150.1, Vlan105, [0/0], 00:06:03, direct 10192.168.150.1/32, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached 11*via 192.168.150.1, Vlan105, [0/0], 00:06:03, local 12192.168.160.0/24, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached 13*via 192.168.160.1, Vlan110, [0/0], 00:01:59, direct 14192.168.160.1/32, ubest/mbest: 1/0, attached 15*via 192.168.160.1, Vlan110, [0/0], 00:01:59, local 16 17switch# show ip interface brief 18 19IP Interface Status for VRF \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;(1) 20Interface IP Address Interface Status 21Vlan105 192.168.150.1 protocol-up/link-up/admin-up 22Vlan110 192.168.160.1 protocol-up/link-up/admin-up 23switch# We can also verify that PC1 and PC2 can ping each other.

I would shy away using an SVI when we are connecting different buildings/sites, and if we a using a some type of transit network to get from point A to point B. Using a routed port is not only easier to configure its easier to troubleshoot, we don't have worry about the problems layer two brings us, like for example redundancy and spanning-tree we just focus on layer three and the redundancies that layer three can offer us. In this example this switch is connected to another switch with multiple links using routed ports. To create a routed port:\nGo into the interface and turn off switchport and add an IP address\n1switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/4 2switch(config-if)# no switchport 3switch(config-if)# ip address 192.168.253.1 255.255.255.252 4switch(config-if)# no shutdown 5switch(config-if)# exit If you have multiple routed ports for redundancy, add another routed port with a different network.\n1switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/5 2switch(config-if)# no switchport 3switch(config-if)# ip add 192.168.253.5 255.255.255.252 4switch(config-if)# no shutdown 5switch(config-if)# exit We would do the same thing on the other side of the link and make sure our networks match so that each switch can reach other out of the two routed ports we created and in this example they can.\n1switch(config)# show ip interface brief 2 3IP Interface Status for VRF \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;(1) 4Interface IP Address Interface Status 5Eth1/4 192.168.253.2 protocol-up/link-up/admin-up 6Eth1/5 192.168.253.6 protocol-up/link-up/admin-up 7switch(config)# 8switch(config)# ping 192.168.253.1 9PING 192.168.253.1 (192.168.253.1): 56 data bytes 1064 bytes from 192.168.253.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=254 time=1.368 ms 1164 bytes from 192.168.253.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=1.205 ms 1264 bytes from 192.168.253.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=254 time=2.099 ms 1364 bytes from 192.168.253.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=254 time=1.166 ms 1464 bytes from 192.168.253.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=254 time=1.353 ms 15 16--- 192.168.253.1 ping statistics --- 175 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.00% packet loss 18round-trip min/avg/max = 1.166/1.438/2.099 ms 19switch(config)# ping 192.168.253.5 20PING 192.168.253.5 (192.168.253.5): 56 data bytes 2164 bytes from 192.168.253.5: icmp_seq=0 ttl=254 time=1.45 ms 2264 bytes from 192.168.253.5: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=1.28 ms 2364 bytes from 192.168.253.5: icmp_seq=2 ttl=254 time=0.995 ms 2464 bytes from 192.168.253.5: icmp_seq=3 ttl=254 time=1.408 ms 2564 bytes from 192.168.253.5: icmp_seq=4 ttl=254 time=1.303 ms 26 27--- 192.168.253.5 ping statistics --- 285 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.00% packet loss 29round-trip min/avg/max = 0.995/1.287/1.45 ms 30switch(config)# Although you could have created an SVI for these point to point links, I don't think there's a reason.

On paper it sounds good but in the \u0026quot;real\u0026quot; world there probably is tipping point, more redundancy increases complexity. In this post we'll aim to keep it simple, with setting up a Cisco ASA HA active/standby pair and then add in the second ISP. Let's get started! So this is what our topology will look like all said and done, we have two firewalls and two different ISPs. The primary ISP is ISP-1 and the secondary ISP is ISP-2. We will always be using ISP-1 as the primary and won't be load balancing between the two. ISP-2 will only be used when ISP-1 goes offline. When ISP-1 comes back online we will switch back over to ISP-1.\nSo let's first look at getting the ASA HA pair setup. In this example I have two ASA's that are the same hardware and software version, For the HA I have to be able to use two interfaces for the LAN failover and State link interface. I need to choose one ASA that will be the primary and one that is secondary. If you already have a configuration on one ASA, choose that as the primary. The secondary ASA just needs enough configuration so that you can get into it as the configuration gets overwritten on the secondary ASA from the primary.\n1ASA-HA-1(config)# failover 2ASA-HA-1(config)# failover lan unit primary Move to the secondary ASA\n1ASA-HA-1(config)# failover 2ASA-HA-1(config)# failover lan unit secondary Now I need to configure the interfaces each ASA will be using two interfaces and they are connected directly to each other. Configuration is the same across the two ASAs with the exception of the IP address make sure they are different and are in the same network. I like to use a completely different range of IP addresses that are not in my network or public IP networks, otherwise you get into trouble. ;) In this example I'm using the link local address RFC 3927.\n1ASA-HA-1(config)# failover lan interface FAILOVER GigabitEthernet0/3 2ASA-HA-1(config)# failover key password 3ASA-HA-1(config)# failover link STATELINK GigabitEthernet0/4 4ASA-HA-1(config)# failover interface ip FAILOVER 169.254.255.1 255.255.255.252 standby 169.254.255.2 Once you have configured both ASAs the primary will sync its configuration to the secondary and you will now have an active/standby pair of ASAs. You can verify the status by issuing the command show failover. We now need to switch gears and configure our secondary ISP and modify the primary ISP interface (OUTSIDE-ISP-1). On the primary ISP we need to configure a standby IP address on the interface and it needs to be on the same network. So in this example the standby IP is going to be 198.51.100.5 which was available to use from our primary ISP. We also need to do the same thing on the our secondary ISP interface (OUTSIDE-ISP-2. In this example the IP address is 198.51.100.140. Below is running configuration for that, this would be synced to both firewalls since they are now in an HA pair.\n1interface GigabitEthernet0/0 2nameif OUTSIDE-ISP-1 3security-level 0 4ip address 198.51.100.10 255.255.255.128 standby 198.51.100.5 5! 6interface GigabitEthernet0/1 7nameif OUTSIDE-ISP-2 8security-level 0 9ip address 198.51.100.135 255.255.255.128 standby 198.51.100.140 10! Once that is done we now need to configure these ASA's to only use the primary ISP. If the primary ISP fails we switch over to the secondary ISP, we are not load balancing between the two, its one or the other. To do that we need to track the route. On this network we have a default static route that points to the primary ISP's next hop address. In this example that is 198.51.100.1 the command to track that route.\n1ASA-HA-1(config)# route OUTSIDE-ISP-1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 198.51.100.1 1 track 1 This does not do anything yet, we are close but we also need to add another default route and point that to the secondary ISP.\n1ASA-HA-1(config)# route OUTSIDE-ISP-2 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 198.51.100.129 254 Notice that I'm putting a distance metric on this route, this has a higher metric than the first default route so it won't be used until the primary route fails.\nThe track command will remove the primary route if it fails and then the ASA will install this the route in the routing table to switch over to the secondary ISP. We still have to configure some additional settings in order for this to work. We need to create an SLA on the ASA, in this example I'm using Google's Public DNS as a reachability test.

I hope this information is helpful\nStatic Comments: gs@plusline.de - Aug 2020, 2019 That's just the routing part. You will have to do the source NAT of your inside prefix depending on the currently used ISP interface. But this is easy. Now try to set up the redundancy with native IPv6 from both providers.... no chance (regardless which method you might chose, DHCPv6-PD for inside, static prefix with 6to6NAT for inside, ...), you will hate the ASA for this.\nRyan - Aug 21, 2019 Yes your right and that was implied PAT/NAT would be enabled on this for this work on the outside interfaces, since its active/standby each ASA has both ISP interfaces on both of them so this is pretty easy setup. Never tired IPv6 on ASA ever! So I'll have to take your word ;) Might play around with that for.... fun. :| Ryan\nbmdfisa101 - May 1, 2020 Thanks Ryan\nJay - May 3, 2020 Hi how would you achieve this on Cisco Firepower 1122 with HA enabled. not using FCM only FDM\nRyan - May 3, 2020 Hey Jay, It would be the same process, it looks like Cisco only recently introduced this feature in 6.5 for Firepower (Service Level Agreement (SLA) Monitor for static routes.) https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/650/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-650/fptd-fdm-get-started.html Hope this Helps. Ryan\nHemant - May 31, 2020 Hi Ryan, Need to know what happens to the connectivity for the devices which were using NAT from primary ISP, if primary ISP link goes down. Manually NAT to secondary ISP IP or what ? Thanks\nRyan - May 31, 2020 Hey Hemant, If the primary link goes down and it fails over to the secondary link your NATed IP will be from the secondary ISP, You would just create a NAT/PAT rule, So when you use the secondary ISP it will use that IP instead of the primary. OUTSIDE-ISP-2 would be the interface you would configure the NAT/PAT rule, just like you would with the OUTSIDE-ISP-1 interface. Hope that Helps Ryan\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2019/03/12/dual-isp-cisco-asa-ha-active/standby/","section":"post","tags":["ASA","Cisco","cisco","Internet","Network","technology","Tutorials"],"title":"Dual ISP - Cisco ASA HA Active/Standby"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/tutorials/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tutorials"},{"body":"Let's continue to talk about the Cisco Firepower Management Center, in this post we are going to look at sending connection events over to syslog. In this example I'm using Graylog which is an open source logging platform and although any syslog server would work, one of the problems with syslogs is there is little uniformity when you have different systems sending these logs. One of the things that Graylog can to do is extract the raw message and put each part of message into a separate searchable field. We'll configure the FMC to send syslogs and then configure an extractor on Graylog.\nSo we have the FMC and Graylog in our environment setup. We'll want to first configure the FMC and add a syslog server. We can do this two ways, one way is we can go to into Policy tab-\u0026gt; Actions-\u0026gt;Alerts-\u0026gt;Create Alert (Down Arrow)-\u0026gt;Create Syslog Alert. You could also go into an access control policy and select log ( ) icon either in the default action or on a rule you would like to log. Another window will show and select the green plus icon and add the syslog server that way. Once that is out-of-the-way we can now go into Graylog and configure an extractor on the syslog input. This is located under System-\u0026gt;Inputs then under the syslog input select manage extractor. On the actions tab select import extractor and paste this JSON followed by selecting the Add extractors to input at the bottom of the page.\n1{ 2 \u0026#34;extractors\u0026#34;: [ 3 { 4 \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FMC – Default Fields\u0026#34;, 5 \u0026#34;extractor_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;grok\u0026#34;, 6 \u0026#34;converters\u0026#34;: [], 7 \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: 15, 8 \u0026#34;cursor_strategy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;copy\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;source_field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;, 10 \u0026#34;target_field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 11 \u0026#34;extractor_config\u0026#34;: { 12 \u0026#34;grok_pattern\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;%{WORD:field}: Protocol: %{WORD:protocol}, SrcIP: %{IP:Source_IP}, OriginalClientIP: ::, DstIP: %{IP:Destination_IP}, SrcPort: %{INT:src_port}, DstPort: %{INT:dest_port}, TCPFlags: %{WORD:flags}, IngressZone: %{HOSTNAME:ingress_zone}, EgressZone: %{HOSTNAME:egress_zone}, DE: %{DATA:detect_engine}, Policy: %{DATA:policy}, ConnectType: %{WORD:connectType}, AccessControlRuleName: %{DATA:ACLRuleName}, AccessControlRuleAction: %{DATA:ACLRuleAction},\u0026#34;, 13 \u0026#34;named_captures_only\u0026#34;: true 14 }, 15 \u0026#34;condition_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;regex\u0026#34;, 16 \u0026#34;condition_value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;( SFIMS:)\u0026#34; 17 } 18 ], 19 \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2.4.6\u0026#34; 20} I have noticed that it might take some time for Graylog to extract the messages as well as it seems there is a delay in the Cisco FMC when sending syslogs but If everything is configured correctly you should start to see logs coming into Graylog. I normally use this for researching firewall rules as its easier to run a search in Graylog then it is on the FMC. Here is what the raw message looks like:\n1_DMZ-FW02 SFIMS: Protocol: TCP, SrcIP: 172.25.45.55, OriginalClientIP: ::, DstIP: 172.25.30.82, SrcPort: 58996, DstPort: 1433, TCPFlags: 0x0, IngressZone: LOC-DMZ, EgressZone: LOC-INSIDE, DE: Primary Detection Engine (d4d9f400-c6d2-4065-9f90-da61a963b980), Policy: Acme DMZ ACP, ConnectType: Start, AccessControlRuleName: WEBSRVS-\u0026gt;SQLSRVS-\u0026gt;TCP1443, AccessControlRuleAction: Allow, Prefilter Policy: Default Prefilter Policy, UserName: No Authentication Required, InitiatorPackets: 2, ResponderPackets: 1, InitiatorBytes: 120, ResponderBytes: 66, NAPPolicy: Acme DMZ NAP, DNSResponseType: No Error, Sinkhole: Unknown, URLCategory: Unknown, URLReputation: Risk unknown_ Here is what Graylog would be able to extract from that message with our extractor:\n1ACLRuleAction 2Allow 3ACLRuleName 4WEBSRVS-\u0026gt;SQLSRVS-\u0026gt;TCP1443 5Destination_IP 6172.25.30.82 7Source_IP 8172.25.45.55 9connectType 10Start 11dest_port 121433 13detect_engine 14Primary Detection Engine (d4d9f400-c6d2-4065-9f90-da61a963b980) 15egress_zone 16LOC-INSIDE 17field 18SFIMS 19flags 200x0 21ingress_zone 22LOC-DMZ 23policy 24Acme DMZ ACP 25protocol 26TCP 27src_port 2858996 With this grok pattern that we created with Graylog we are able to search these fields like Source IP and Destination IP and even the ACLRule name.

Remember the names like TRILL, and IEEE 802.1aq (SPB) or Cisco's FabicPath technologies? You had all of these different flavors that showed a lot progress, but they never really took off for one reason or another. The funny part is this protocol we are all trying kill off is still alive and doing well, so let's look at spanning tree in the meantime because you will likely run into it.\nRemember there are multiple types of spanning tree protocols but they all have a common theme to them and in this post we are going to be focusing on those common themes. If you need a refresher about the reasons and basic functions of spanning tree you can check out these posts I did quite a while ago.\nThe Beginnings of Layer Two Redundancy The Middle of Layer Two Redundancy The “Ending” of Layer Two Redundancy So we should already know that by default spanning tree is enabled on all ports when the switch has blank config. There are of course tweaks we can do to adjust convergence times like using RSTP, if thirty seconds is too long, using portfast when there is not another switch downstream, lots of customization. Here is a simple topology, two switches two links, one of links will be blocked otherwise expect loops and network inconsistency. Out of the box STP will protect you from loops, and a simple way to figure what type of spanning tree protocol is running as well as to figure out who is root you can use this command:\n1SW2#show spanning-tree 2 3VLAN0001 4 Spanning tree enabled protocol rstp 5 Root ID Priority 32769 6 Address aabb.cc00.0200 7 This bridge is the root 8 Hello Time 2 sec Max Age 20 sec Forward Delay 15 sec 9 10 Bridge ID Priority 32769 (priority 32768 sys-id-ext 1) 11 Address aabb.cc00.0200 12 Hello Time 2 sec Max Age 20 sec Forward Delay 15 sec 13 Aging Time 300 sec 14 15Interface Role Sts Cost Prio.Nbr Type 16------------------- ---- --- --------- -------- ---------------------- 17Et0/0 Desg FWD 100 128.1 P2p 18Et0/1 Desg FWD 100 128.2 P2p 19Et0/2 Desg FWD 100 128.3 P2p 20Et0/3 Desg FWD 100 128.4 P2p We can see that we are on the root bridge, by looking at Root ID information. This shows information about who is root and in this case we are on the root switch, seeing the message This bridge is the root, confirms that. We can also see the type of spanning tree protocol we are running, which is RSTP. Running the command on the other switch, that is not root we can the BLK status on one of its ports (Et0/1) which is what we are expecting. We can also see who is root. If we look at the Bridge ID that's the local switch we are on. Notice when you are the root switch both the Root ID and Bridge match. So our topology looks like something like this:\n1SW1#show spanning-tree 2 3VLAN0001 4 Spanning tree enabled protocol rstp 5 Root ID Priority 32769 6 Address aabb.cc00.0200 7 Cost 100 8 Port 1 (Ethernet0/0) 9 Hello Time 2 sec Max Age 20 sec Forward Delay 15 sec 10 11 Bridge ID Priority 32769 (priority 32768 sys-id-ext 1) 12 Address aabb.cc00.0300 13 Hello Time 2 sec Max Age 20 sec Forward Delay 15 sec 14 Aging Time 300 sec 15 16Interface Role Sts Cost Prio.Nbr Type 17------------------- ---- --- --------- -------- ---------------------- 18Et0/0 Root FWD 100 128.1 P2p 19Et0/1 Altn BLK 100 128.2 P2p 20Et0/2 Desg FWD 100 128.3 P2p 21Et0/3 Desg FWD 100 128.4 P2p So by default spanning tree helped us block a redundant path without us really doing anything. So why bother with it? Well there is always fine tuning like turning on portfast which is used for edge devices, timers for STP to make it converge faster. There are also some protections that should be enabled like using BPDU guard which help guard the spanning tree topology from introducing unauthorized devices from sending BPDUs and usually used on access ports. Another one is Root guard which is used to help protect the root bridge from changing. Root guard is similar to BPDU guard but I like to think this protection is for us network engineers for when we introduce a switch into the network that somehow as a lower priority than the existing root bridge we can protect the network from changing the STP topology.\nFailures Am I doing a good job of making this protocol shine? Well like everything there is always another side of it and I would say some of the failures can be a misconfiguration, software incompatibilities/bugs (which is more common than you would think) and overgrowth of the STP design. When this happens the STP topology can become disruptive to the entire layer two design while trying to reconverge into a new shape, meanwhile switch CPUs hit all time highs and network availability hits all zeros. Another valid point is its a waste of money, you buy two of everything but you can't use both at the same time because you can't have multiple L2 paths. Sure you can add MLAGs/vPCs but spanning tree is still running and if that protocol becomes unstable, or changes the topology it has the potential to still be disruptive. ...and this is why a lot people dislike this technology, It really wasn't designed for high-availability, multi-path, layer two domains.\nMove up a layer? Traditionally L2/L3 boundary is at the distribution/aggregation layer of the network, but this traditional design is changing to IP routing at the access layer (Routed Access Layer) to remove spanning tree However this may work well for client/end-user access, this type of design fails at the data center. You may have racks of servers in your data center, you want the maximum amount a flexibility to move hardware around as well as add additional hardware in the future. If you did a routed access layer at the data center, you start to lock yourself in and although its 2019 a lot applications still operate at a layer two level and even if the apps you are running don't have that problem you run into scalability issues.\nSmoke and Mirrors? So where's the magic? How do you use a reliable layer three network like you did in on the client/end-user side but put it in a data center? Think network overlays like VxLAN or BGP EVPN, (EVPN BGP), (order does not matter, they're the same thing) 😉 Basically these are network overlay technologies, you have you underlayer network that is running and you put this technology on top of that network, I call it network virtualization but you may have also heard SDN, (Software Define Networking). Whatever you want to call it this is how you kill spanning tree. Spanning tree by default just runs on a layer two network, we saw that from the beginning. So you remove layer two from the entire stack and then overlay an additional network on top of that. Using these type of technologies your applications don't know the difference. Another helpful post I saw when reading about overlay networks was from David Varnum's post about how Arista Networks uses BGP EVPN, pretty neat technology, if interested.\nArista BGP EVPN – Overview and Concepts\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2019/01/02/oh...spanning-tree/","section":"post","tags":["Data center","Network","Spanning Tree Protocol","STP","technology","VxLAN"],"title":"Oh...Spanning Tree"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/spanning-tree-protocol/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Spanning Tree Protocol"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/stp/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"STP"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/vxlan/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"VxLAN"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/api/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"API"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/barracuda/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"barracuda"},{"body":"Working on my Powershell skills, I was playing around with a Barracuda Load Balancer and noticed it supported some APIs which is kind of cool. At first I was playing around with it in postman and got to login and put some servers in maintenance mode, but then thought it would be really neat if I could get this working in Powershell, that way us humans can just run a script and even thinking in the \u0026quot;future\u0026quot; maybe have some automated process (a.k.a AI) handle this for us. ;) So in this post I'll talk about the script I created and some of the small challenges I had with this overall it was kind of neat putting this together. TLDR: Here is the script if you don't want to read:\n1# Barracuda Load Balancer Powershell Script 2# Minimum version of Powershell is 6.0.4 – Can download stable releases @ https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell 3# Puts servers in Maintenance, Disable or Enable status 4# Put the URI API of the LB (example: \u0026#34;https://192.168.1.5/restapi/v2\u0026amp;quot;) 5$uri = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; 6# Put the group name, usually its \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; unless you have something different 7$groupname = \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; 8# Put the service name you would like to modify, you can find this in the LB going to BASIC-\u0026gt;Services 9$servicename = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; 10# Put the server you would like to modify, you can find the names of the servers under BASIC-\u0026gt;Services 11# You can add additional servers to this list if you want to modify multiple servers at once, add additional variables 12$realserver1 = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; 13$realserver2 = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; 14# What status would you change the servers in the LB to?

Barracuda only uses the username as the token to login. So I needed to configure Powershell to null the password when logging with the API token. A quick search on the web led me to create the $lbcred variable.\nAnother small gotcha was when using the default version of Powershell on Windows 10 I was having a problem with the login and really didn't want to create a curl header or anything like that. I also wanted to keep the username and password out of the script. When you run the script it will ask you what the username and password is and use that while the script it running, I thought it would be easier. So when researching this, and I didn't actually know this but there are different updated versions of Powershell which are available on GitHub and they work different operating systems besides Windows. So that's pretty cool, and also tells you how much I pay attention to Powershell :).\nWhen looking at the release notes for Powershell 6.0.4 they made some modifications to the Invoke-RestMethod command for -Authentication switch so I downloaded Powrshell 6.0.4 and then found it does not work with Powershell ISE. :(\nWhich is what I have been using and I now needed to download Visual Studio Code which is a free download and install the Powershell extenstion so that I could run it within that program. Again just goes to show you how much I know about this stuff. After all of that I was able to login into the load balancer using the token API!\nThe last command I just needed a json to tell the load balancer want I wanted to do with the servers, I could put them in maintenance, enable or disable status and if I had more than one server in the load balancer, I just copied the command again and used a different variable for each server. After that I was able to put servers in a different via Powershell!\nStatic Comments: Ryan - Feb 15, 2019\nJeremy, That token is usually only good for a limited time, its best to get a new one each time you run the script. Ryan\nJeremy Edwards - Feb 15, 2019\nI also already generated a token, so that part isn't necessary for the script to generate if there is a way to incorporate the token into a field.\nRyan - Feb 15, 2019\nJeremy, That error tells me that you are connecting over HTTP instead of HTTPS, I would use HTTPS when doing anything that involves passwords, and really anything nowadays. If you read the error message it tells you what you need to do if you want to use HTTP add the -AllowUnencryptedAuthentication to the Invoke-RestMethod. There a multiple ways to put the username and password in the script, a common way is to create a key file and a password file. A search engine is your friend :) The reason I did not use it in this script is I didn't have a good place to store to the the password or key file securely. By having the username and password prompt it also gives you time to cancel the script in case you run it by accident... Ryan\nJeremy Edwards - Feb 5, 2019\nRyan, I updated to PowerShell 6.1.2 and ran the script again. That did fix the username/password issue, but I'm still getting an error. Also, how would we run this if we wanted the username and password to be kept in the script? My boss wants it fully automated with no user intervention.

I have been trying to understand a use case around using it with network automation. Recently I have been dancing around with Ansible. My personal belief is that using any type of these tools would be helpful but it can be a steep learning curve if you really don't have any programming knowledge. This is not something that is relatively easy to use or understand, don't expect to have a working network automated tool in production on day one. I think this is great for learning, and using this in a network sandbox. If you don't have programming mindset it might make your job harder on day one before it gets easier, but just like learning to dance you have to learn the steps, the moves, and maintain the rhythm. So with that let's at least figure out the starting points, and begin learning the steps of the automation dance. ;)\nDIY Tooling? All of these automated frameworks are tools, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Saltstack, etc. These are all tools that can be used to automate your device to do whatever you're trying to accomplish without manual configuration, that's the goal. All of these tools are \u0026quot;freemium\u0026quot;, they are available on Github and you can use them however you want, The catch with all of these tools is they are a framework, if you want something fancy integration or some web interface, and have additional smarts with the product, then you're going to pay for it or you could build it yourself and stick to the man. Just need to increase payroll and hire developers, which just takes your goal of automating your network infrastructure to maybe day 365? Remember you still have to maintain it, patch it, upgrade it. (Does it still work after all of that?) You're not in the business of developing a platform that makes these tools easier to work with, that's the reason they all have paid options.\nBut... \u0026quot;I'm just going to use the CLI of one of those tools and develop my own playbooks, cookbooks, manifests, salt states, and make it work!\u0026quot;\nI would say most people exploring automation go this route, and it's not a bad starting point when looking at all of these tools they all have these common themes:\nDeprecated feature that was referenced on the internet somewhere long ago and it worked at that time, but now the tool does this instead of that. Documentation is lacking and it becomes difficult to find what you are looking for, like config examples, error messages, and overall architecture of the tool, how does it work?, best practices?, etc. Tools are used incorrectly when referencing what other people posted online. An example is like seeing playbooks, cookbooks, manifests, or salt states have plain/hashed passwords in them! Some tools (Ansible) offer a vault for passwords but people don't use them or know about them! These aren't showstoppers but keep these in mind when starting out. All of these tools come with a foundation that doesn't change so learn from that and then begin to branch out, and it might help to buy a book if you are committed.\nCall it quits? I wouldn't, this is where you need to stop and think, before even exploring these tools and ask yourself what would automation (tool) help at XYZ? If you are not thinking about automation you should start! Crawl, walk, run when exploring automation It's important to learn first, sandbox next and develop continuelsy. I saw this post on Reddit last week (For those who if they keep hearing \u0026quot;DevOps\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Python \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Automation\u0026quot; are gonna kill somebody... read on) and totally agree, I don't think we are expecting someone with superhero skills that can whip up automation and have us say.. \u0026quot;Alexa..fix the network\u0026quot; but I do think we need to shift focus on it by thinking about it, learning about it, and then using it. ;)\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2018/11/13/automation-dance/","section":"post","tags":["Automation","General","Internet","Network","Open source","technology"],"title":"Automation Dance"},{"body":"Starting from ASA 9.3(2) and onward the 5500-X hardware supports a RESTful API as an additional method for configuration/monitoring ASA hardware. Infrastructure as code as they call it, not anything new but I was reading a post that Ivan Pepelnjak wrote and as he points out there are two types of styles when we are dealing with IaC, the data model or CRUD. When reading information about the ASA RESTful API it was interesting what the ASA falls into, CRUD is the method it uses and although this method works, I have similar feeling to what Ivan posted, it wonders me if this is really a step forward into IaC. In this post we'll go through the steps to enable it and you can be the judge, does this RESTful API help?\nSo the first thing we need to grab the RESTful API application and by default is not included so we'll need to go to cisco.com and download it. You need look for the Adaptive Security Appliance REST API Plugin and depending on your version of ASA there might be some gotchas on which versions to use so read the release notes. Once we you have the correct version downloaded you need to upload it to the ASA flash. Once uploaded you have to specify the location of the REST API Plugin:\n1ASA-HA-1(config)# rest-api image flash:asa-restapi-132325-lfbff-k8.SPA 2Computed Hash SHA2: 2106d6ac8c4e3c181c4820fb46588b8c 3 e104712e13fb783ad8f051e905c21330 4 0ad66d0e96a6f050805e1e7dc173f187 5 211c87db0c2d440da2e2d8614a210e4c 6 7Embedded Hash SHA2: 2106d6ac8c4e3c181c4820fb46588b8c 8 e104712e13fb783ad8f051e905c21330 9 0ad66d0e96a6f050805e1e7dc173f187 10 211c87db0c2d440da2e2d8614a210e4c 11 12Digital signature validated successfully 13ASA-HA-1(config)# After that you can enable the REST API:\n1ASA-HA-1(config)# rest-api agent\\[/code\\] Once enabled if you have ASDM enabled then the HTTP service is running if not you have to enable the HTTP server as well as configure a management rule to tell what interface you will be connecting to.\n1http server enable 2http 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 After that you can browse to the following link: https://ASAIP/doc/\nYou will get prompt to login with a username and password, so make sure the authentication is configured on the ASA. If you have login successfully you will see a webpage like this:\nFrom here you can explore the different HTTP requests that are available and you essentially have another way of configuring and monitoring your ASA. So back my question does this type of RESTful API help you? I have explored this and have used Postman for my poor mans \u0026quot;IaC\u0026quot; but does that count, I feel something is missing? In the end it's still a process that runs and instead of running this via CLI its a CRUD API... - Ryan\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2018/10/08/enable-a-restful-asa-api/","section":"post","tags":["API","ASA","Cisco","IaC","Network","RESTful"],"title":"Enable a RESTful ASA API"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/iac/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IaC"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/restful/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"RESTful"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/firepower/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Firepower"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/firewall/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"firewall"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ngfw/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"NGFW"},{"body":"We are back with another post about Cisco's Firepower Management Center and this time we are working with the DNS list which if you have a protect license you can have your Firepower modules or your FTD (Firepower Threat Defense) devices look at DNS requests and deny the requests if they are malicious. These have to be applied on your access control policy to be able to use it and in this post we are going verify some of the domain names that are in this lists.\nSo this post is already assuming that you have an Access Control Policy deployed on a Firepower Module (ASA) or a FTD. We also are assuming that you have a DNS policy applied to the FM/FTD. These lists get downloaded about every two hours from Cisco and are updated regularly, best to keep it that way. :) However like everything there is always someone, some system, some program that fails to connect and more often than not it's usually this critical process that worked yesterday but doesn't today, so how do we check if we are hitting this?\nThere are two ways to check this we can look at the connection events (if you are logging which by default is yes) it will show DNS the events and depending on your policy you'll see the action taken. In this example we selected to use Domain Not Found for the action. In this example we can see Domain Not Found and we can also see the DNS category its hitting which is DNS Dga.\nNote: I have edited this screenshot to show example.com instead of the malicious domain\nWe can verify the domain is in this list DNS Dga by connecting to the FMC via SSH and browse to the actual list which is located at /var/sf/sidns_download. When you browse to this location you'll see something like this:\n1admin@FMC:/var/sf/sidns_download$ 2admin@FMC:/var/sf/sidns_download$ ls 3032ba433-c295-11e4-a919-d4ae5275b77b Cisco_DNS_Intelligence_Feed 41b117672-7453-478c-be31-b72e89ca2dde IPRVersion.dat 523f2a124-8278-4c03-8c9d-d28fe08b71ab abdc925f-4f85-4504-90a7-c891979ad82a 62CCDA18E-DDFF-4F5C-AF9A-F00985219707 b1df3aa8-2841-4c88-8e64-bfaacec7111f 72b15cb6f-a3fc-4e0e-a342-ccc5e5804576 d7d996a6-6b92-4a56-8f10-e8506e432fb8 830f9e69c-d64c-479c-821d-0e4edab8348d health 93e2af68e-5fc8-4b1c-b5bc-b4e7cab5abcd health_status 105a0b6d6b-e2c3-436f-b4a1-48248b331d39 health_statuslock 115f8148f1-e5e4-427a-aa3b-ee1c2745d663 peers 1260f4e2ab-d96c-44a0-bd38-830252b65259 rep_dd.yaml 136ba968f4-7a25-4793-a2c8-7cc77f1f1074 tmp 14A27C6AAE-8E52-4174-A81A-47C59FECd3a5 Each of these UIDs correspond to DNS feed. For example b1df3aa8-2841-4c88-8e64-bfaacec7111f is for DNS Dga category. You can easily figure out which UID is tied to which DNS category by using the more command, notice the top of the file.\nNote: I have replaced these domains with examples instead of the malicious domains\n1admin@FMC:/var/sf/sidns_download$ more b1df3aa8-2841-4c88-8e64-bfaacec7111f 2#Cisco DNS and URL intelligence feed: DNS Dga 3example.info 4example.com 5example.net 6... We can see in this example that the domain we where trying to resolve is in this blacklist. Usually you'll have to grep the file to find the domain as these lists can be big, to find a domain follow this command, I'm looking in the DNS Dga category.\n1admin@FMC:/var/sf/sidns_download$ more b1df3aa8-2841-4c88-8e64-bfaacec7111f |grep example.com 2example.com 3admin@FMC:/var/sf/sidns_download$ This confirms it and we can can either whitelist it or drop the category and then redeploy polices, unless you run into a bug, which I have ran into with whitelisting as it does not seem to work with some older firepower code. Another upgrade is in the works, in the meantime I dropped the DNS category, I hope this information is helpful, - Ryan\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2018/09/07/verifying-dns-lists-fmc/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","Firepower","firewall","FMC","Network","NGFW"],"title":"Verifying DNS Lists - FMC"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/gns3/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"GNS3"},{"body":"Although GNS3 can run local on your computer and you can use VMware Workstation and have the GNS3 appliance. I found it much more stable and predictable to run GNS3 on a dedicated server. Using this type of installation, all the projects, and images are stored on the GNS3 server, so I can install the GNS3 client any computer and get access to the same projects I was working on. You can also have multiple people working on different projects that are on the same server. I find that neat for educational use or if you where helping someone with a project. In this post I’ll walk though the steps needed to set up a GNS3 server.\nThe first thing we need to have is an Ubuntu server 16.04.4 operating system installed, as of writing this GNS3 server only supports 16.04.x LTS, some people have had issues with using Ubuntu’s 18.04 LTS which was released in April of this year. We are about halfway through LTS cycle with 16.04 with support ending in April of 2021, still got time. ;) Once you have Ubuntu server 16.04 installed and a static IP address assigned we now need to run the GNS3 script, move to the tmp folder.\n1cd /tmp 2curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GNS3/gns3-server/master/scripts/remote-install.sh \u0026amp;gt; gns3-remote-install.sh 3bash gns3-remote-install.sh --with-openvpn --with-iou --with-i386-repository Ubuntu Server will download and add the GNS3 PPA (Personal Package Archive) once that finishes which takes about 10 to 15 minutes, go ahead and reboot the system. After a reboot we need to download OpenVPN client for your computer and download the configuration from the GNS3 server. You’ll notice a banner upon a successful login on the GNS3 server, copy that URL and paste in your web browser to download the OpenVPN configuration file. The server will detect your external IP address, just use your statically configured internal address to connect to it if you are local. In this example the internal IP address of this GNS3 server is 192.168.127.131. Depending how you are connecting to the GNS3 Server you might need to edit the OpenVPN configuration file. If you will be connecting from the Internet it will probably work, like if you are using a hosting provider like Packet.net, AWS or your own ISP. If you will normally be connecting from your internal network which is mostly likely the case, you need to edit the bottom of the OpenVPN file to the statically configured IP address you configured when you installed the Ubuntu operating system. In this example the GNS3 server internal IP is 192.168.127.131 so I’ll edit the file with a simple text editor.\nOnce that is done we should be able to connect to our GNS3 server using the OpenVPN client. When you configure a GNS3 server you must use the OpenVPN regardless if you are locally on the same network or over the internet. We are now ready to go ahead and install the GNS3 client on your computer. In this example I'm using Windows, the GNS3 client can also be used in Linux. When you download and install the GNS3 client I usually leave everything at the defaults except the SolarWinds and NCAP most of this stuff is already on the server and I let the installer do the rest.\nAfter the installation is finished go ahead and start GNS3 the first time, you are greeted with a Setup Wizard window. We are using a GNS3 server, so everything is going to run on it. Select the Run everything on a remote server (advanced usage).\nAnother screen will want to know the IP address of the server to connect to, you need to use the OpenVPN IP address of 172.16.253.1. By default there is no user authentication, also before selecting next make sure you are connected to the GNS3 server with OpenVPN.\nAfter selecting next GNS3 will verify it can connect to the server and then ask you if want to start importing appliances into GNS3.\nYou now have a GNS3 server ready to go, everything runs on this server, your projects, images and any snapshots all run on this server. When there are updates to GNS3 a simple sudo apt-upgrade command will update server and any GNS3 components automatically the only thing you need to do is update your GNS3 client so that the version match on both sides. Some things I noticed when using a GNS3 server is that is changes your host name when you run the GNS3 script but does not change the host file on the server so you might notice when you attempt to shut down or reboot the system, or do any sudo commands it can sometimes hang for a bit, and you get this message:\n1sudo: unable to resolve host gns3vm\\[/code\\] To fix that you just need to add in the gns3vm to the host file of the GNS3 server, in this example I'm using nano, and I just added the gns3vm in the host file using a different address of the in loopback space.\n1sudo nano /etc/hosts 2sudo password for ryan: 3127.0.0.1 localhost 4192.168.127.131 ubuntu 5127.0.0.253 gns3vm I also have not had any problems with security updates and just let the Ubuntu server do that automatically when you first setup the operating system, overall its been a good experience. The server I have GNS3 running has a 256GB SSD, an Intel Xeon E3-1270V5 processor with 32GB of RAM and really no complainants, that's all I got and like always I hope this information is helpful.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2018/08/17/installing-a-gns3-server/","section":"post","tags":["GNS3","Network","Open source","tutorial"],"title":"Installing a GNS3 Server"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/tutorial/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"tutorial"},{"body":"No management centers here, sometimes a standalone firewall is all you need. In this post I have a FTD appliance and there really isn’t a need tie this into Cisco’s Firepower Management Center. So we’ll configure appliance in standalone mode and go through the initial first steps that are required to get it online and walk through Firepower Device Manager. If you worked with Cisco FMC you’ll find its pretty similar, so with introductions out-of-the-way let’s get started!\nYou are still recommended to have a management network connected to this appliance, here is the topology for this example, thanks GNS3 ;) On first boot you must give the appliance some minutes to boot up when you first turn it on. It starts a first boot process which goes through building and setting up everything it needs. Once the unit is primed and ready you should see a login prompt, login with the default username and password which is admin/Admin123 the appliance will go ahead and display a EULA, agree to it and then the system will want you to change the password. You will then be walked through the initial setup of setting up your management IP address, gateway, DNS servers and after that you will be asked if you want to manage the device locally, since we are not using a FMC make sure to answer YES.\nMP4 FTDv\nOnce the device is ready to go, connect via HTTPS to the management IP address of the appliance with a web browser, and login into the system with the password you configured.\nWhen you first login the setup wizard will walk you through setting up two zones, and inside zone and an outside zone. Or you could skip this step if you scroll down to the bottom of the page. This is helpful if you don’t have internet connection or if you simply want to configure this yourself. In this example I accepted all the defaults. Once you are done with the initial setup screen you will be directed to the main dashboard.\nBelieve it or not your now are ready to configure this appliance, if you used the FMC before this has the same wordage so it’ll be familiar to you. If you never worked with FMC or any of these newer Firepower Threat Defense firewalls it might be a learning curve but the built-in help on this is useful, and it’s a good starting point. You can also tie this into the Cisco Defense Orchestrator which is a cloud-based paid tool to help you apply polices to multiple devices. This is nice, so you don’t have to manually configure each device, kind of like a slimmed down version of the FMC.\nIf you have worked with Cisco ASAs you’ll notice that you can’t just copy the running-config and paste it on new device. These things are complicated underneath the GUI, which is also why you can only use a GUI. They have everything, but the kitchen sink essentially, basic firewall rules, URL filtering, IPS, identify policies, security intelligence feeds, file polices and SSL Decryption. That stuff just doesn’t work with a static config file and really can’t be configured via CLI like our old friend ASA/PIX. Although sometimes annoying it is the direction the industry has moved into, however, if you are still having a hard time and need to reminisce this appliance does offer a CLI pop-up, but it only offers packet-tracer, ping, some show commands are available and trace route. It's not much but it may be enough to move forward, good luck. ;)\nStatic Comments: PrimeUser - Jun 25, 2019\nHi, have you experience when you sub-interface the inside port, you cannot do any intervlan routing?\nRyan - Jun 26, 2019\nI believe you can do inter-vlan routing you just have to create a sub-interface first and then you would be able to use it.\nRemoteYordan - Jan 12, 2020\nHi Guys, i have this problem.

I have also seen this if resources are taxed or if its just starting up... In my case the Firewall was still up and at least passing and blocking traffic but I had to re-image it... Also I think if you are using the FMC this is normal behavior you won't be able to locally configure it, if you have configured the FTDv to use the Firepower Management Center.

Nothing came up, the only thing was a spike in amount of syslog messages of dropped traffic coming from the web servers.\nSo from that point it really wasn’t an issue, but I thought it would be interesting to see what was going on.

This deny action generates the log message that I was seeing, but why would server 172.17.77.250 be sending a rest flag when the connection was already completed? To investigate this further I needed to do a packet capture to be able to determine what else is going on, maybe we where loosing traffic upstream and this was just a dirty TCP session I really couldn’t tell, so I started to capture the inside and outside interfaces on this firewall and here are the results: Inside Interface Capture\n33437: 12:00:47.907301 172.17.77.250.443 \u0026gt; 203.0.113.147.43918: F 2320205170:2320205170(0) ack 991843171 win 65535\n33438: 12:00:47.952480 203.0.113.147.43918 \u0026gt; 172.17.77.250.443: . ack 2320205171 win 65535\n33748: 12:00:50.443687 203.0.113.147.43918 \u0026gt; 172.17.77.250.443: F 991843171:991843171(0) ack 2320205171 win 65535\n33749: 12:00:50.443687 203.0.113.147.43918 \u0026gt; 172.17.77.250.443: R 991843172:991843172(0) ack 2320205171 win 0\n33750: 12:00:50.443748 172.17.77.250.443 \u0026gt; 203.0.113.147.43918: R 2320205171:2320205171(0) win 0\nOn the first capture we can see the server 172.17.77.250 sending a FIN as noted with the letter “F”, so the server starts to end the connection. Following that we can see the client sending an acknowledgment as noted with the “. Ack”. We can also see that the client sends a FIN to finish up the connection. What’s interesting is at the same time the FIN is sent from the client a TCP Reset is also sent from the client. Normally we should have just ended the connection with a FIN and one more acknowledgment (ACK) from 172.17.77.250 since it started the TCP termination process. This would have end the connection peacefully, however in this example the client seems to send a FIN and a RST at the same time which causes 172.17.77.250 to also send a TCP RST back to the client.\nIf we looked at the outside interface capture, we pretty much see the same thing we can see the FIN being sent from 172.17.77.250 and acknowledgment from the client. The client sends the FIN and the reset flags back to 172.17.77.250 which ultimately should have just been a FIN, instead its FIN and RST. Notice we did not see 172.17.77.250 TCP RST across, this was because that packet was already denied from the inside interface.

After that you can see two acknowledgments both are from me. The first ACK is for that TCP Push packet that was created by 172.17.77.250, the second ACK from the client (me) is acknowledgment of the FIN. We have ended the connection peacefully and that’s how it should be.\nHowever, the Internet is a weird place and that’s not what’s happening, so what’s the issue? Well that really was hardest part of this problem and here’s my theory, 172.17.77.250 is sending a TCP RST back to the client is because 172.17.77.250 wasn’t expecting it in the first place. It was finishing up the connection between the client and because of this unexpected TCP packet from the client 172.17.77.250 sends a TCP RST. The connection is not valid, and our server wants to start over. In the meantime, the TCP session was already closed by the firewall because it saw that last FIN from the client. That last TCP RST packet from the server gets denied and never reaches the client, but that still does not answer our question.\nWhy are seeing a FIN and RST from the client in the first place? This TCP connection is using TLS, so I started to look at how TLS functions in a TCP connection. When communication starts, and we finish our TCP handshake, then if the connection is over TLS we do a TLS handshake-\u0026gt; After the two hosts agree on the ciphers and TLS settings data is exchanged encrypted-\u0026gt;After TLS is done with the data TLS should send a close notify to “peacefully” end the TLS session-\u0026gt;Following that TCP closes with a FIN and it is peaceful. :)\nI couldn’t investigate the TLS packet because it was encrypted however I think it had something to do with the close notify action of TLS. Not all implementations of SSL/TLS follow that rule even through RFC 5246 seems to imply that a close notify is required. I think this would explain the reason why the server sends RST when it receives both a FIN and RST at the same time from the client, it was unexpected, and we did not close the TLS session properly. When I did the test, I didn’t get any TCP resets. Although we where not seeing any disruptions from this it was helpful to at least figure out what the problem is and then being able to theorize what we could do to fix that problem.\nIn this example its related to the client so we can’t do anything on our end. The fact that this is happening at the end of the TCP connection, you are not going to notice anyway because you already have data you requested. We don't really care how the connection closes. I hope this post was helpful in understanding how to dig in the weeds and even through the connection worked, its helpful to understand any anomalies because those could turn into problems in the future.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2018/06/20/too-many-tcp-resets/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","firewall","Internet","Network","Security","TCP","technology"],"title":"Too Many TCP Resets"},{"body":"When you want more speed all you need is EtherChannel, EtherChannel can be configured as a layer three logical interface instead of just sitting at layer two. This is very helpful if we are running layer three down to the access layer switches, instead of at the distribution layer. You also could see this in a collapsed core design, we also don’t have to worry too much about STP when we configure EtherChannel’s. The only requirements to use layer three EtherChannels is your switch need is support layer three “routed” interfaces, so with that let's get started!\nThis is pretty much the same as configuring a layer two EtherChannel with one exception, in this example I’ve got three switches one access layer switch and two distribution/core switches. We are running layer three all the way down to the access layer, so we don’t have worry about STP between the two distribution/core switches and remember VLANs/Networks are locally significant to each access layer switch in this design.\nI have already configured SW1 and SW2 links between them as well as the network that SW3 has for the access layer, on SW1 and SW2 we need to create port-channels going to SW3.\n1SW1(config)# interface ethernet2/1-2 2SW1(config-if-range)# channel-group 11 mode active 3SW1(config-if-range)# no shutdown 1SW2(config)# interface ethernet2/1-2 2SW2(config-if-range)# channel-group 12 mode active 3SW2(config-if-range)# no shutdown Next after the port-channels are created we assign an IP address to the port-channel, this just like any other interface instead of using a dedicated port you use the port-channel..simple ;)\n1SW1(config)# interface port-channel 11 2SW1(config-if)# ip address 172.16.0.1/30 1SW2(config)# interface port-channel 12 2SW2(config-if)# ip address 172.16.0.5/30 We now reference the same steps that we did with SW1 and SW2 on SW3.

Each access switch would belong to a different network being able to map devices by physical location, instead of extending VLANs across the campus. I hope this information is helpful, Summer 2018 is right around the corner at the US of A so be sure enjoy it!\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2018/05/07/configuring-layer-three-etherchannel/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","distribution layer","EtherChannel","Network","technology"],"title":"Configuring Layer Three EtherChannel"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/distribution-layer/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"distribution layer"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/etherchannel/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"EtherChannel"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/802.11ax/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"802.11ax"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/vlans/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"vlans"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/wireless/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"wireless"},{"body":"It’s been fun four months of 2018 so far and I’m back to talk about Wireless VLANs. With 802.11ax around the corner (2019) I think we all can agree that “weird” connections although less likely have interference isn’t as mobile as a wireless LAN. Also, with 802.11ax the maximum theoretical throughput is 10Gbps! We’re going to need some serious backend infrastructure available to be able to support that type of bandwidth. So, let’s look at configuring a wireless VLANs for our mobile users!\nJust like regular weird LANs, we want to separate traffic to be able to have a secure network, because it's usually not only your employees that will use the wireless network, we could have guest networks, department networks and even infrastructure/IoT networks. Like for security cameras, motion sensors, thermostats, lights, and so much more, just within that list you have at least three wireless networks if not four if you needed to have further separation. So how do you configure wireless to have multiple VLANs attached to it? First you must look at the wireless hardware you are working with. That hardware at least needs to support a trunk link, that’s what makes this magic happen. If supports VLAN trunks, then chances are it comes in two flavors:\nWireless Controller with “lightweight” access points, which essentially tunnel the traffic back to the controller. The controller has a trunk link with all the Wireless VLANs connected to it. The access points don’t need access to all those wireless VLANs, they can join a management network and route/tunnel the traffic back to the controller. Autonomous access points which as the name suggest act on their own they don’t join a controller and therefore would need access to all wireless VLANs that are configured in the network. Next, if your wireless hardware supports multiple VLANs then it can probably support multiple networks and broadcast multiple SSIDs, which is how you can get multiple wireless networks on the same hardware. Each network can have different restrictions as well as different authentication methods to get on the network. Like using 802.1x (WPA2 Enterprise), WPA2 Personal, and even WPA3 which was certified this year. Once you have all that information and know what type of access point you have the last thing to do is configuring the switchport which is probably the simplest thing when it comes to WLANs. So in this example we have four networks that we want to put on the airwaves.\n(410) - GUEST-WLAN (420) - MARKET-DEPT-WLAN (430) - DEFUALT-EMPLOYEE-WLAN (440) - SECURITY-WLAN If we look at show vlan output we can see I have the VLANs created on this switch.\n1VLAN Name Status Ports 2---- -------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------- 31 default active Eth2/1, Eth2/2, Eth2/3, Eth2/4 4 Eth2/5 5410 GUEST-WLAN active Eth2/1, Eth2/2, Eth2/3, Eth2/4 6 Eth2/5 7420 MARKET-DEPT-WLAN active Eth2/1, Eth2/2, Eth2/3, Eth2/4 8 Eth2/5 9430 DEFUALT-EMPLOYEE-WLAN active Eth2/1, Eth2/2, Eth2/3, Eth2/4 10 Eth2/5 11440 SECURITY-WLAN active Eth2/1, Eth2/2, Eth2/3, Eth2/4 In this example I have a wireless controller connected to ethernet 2/10. I simply need to add a trunk link and only allow these VLANs to the port.\n1SW01(config)# interface ethernet 2/10 2SW01(config-if)# switchport mode trunk 3SW01(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 410,420,430,440 4SW01(config-if)# no shutdown I would do the same configuration if I was using an autonomous access point, I would also probably add a management VLAN as well. This configuration would need to be applied to every access point that is connected within the organization. Wireless is going to continue to grow and this is just another side of how much bandwidth wireless is going to take up. I find it hard to imagine that weird networks might be the thing of the past for end-users but it’s moving into the direction, especially when you can get more than 1Gbps out of a wireless connection, that changes things. You now must look at getting switches that support either NBASE-T or even just 10GBASE-T otherwise what’s the point of buying that 802.11ax access point? The silver lining in all of this is it gets cheaper on the switching side :) That’s all I got for now, I hope this information is helpful.\nStatic Comments: Loopy - Aug 4, 2018\nWith the 2500 WLCs, are two physical interfaces REALLY required to securely separate Guest from Internal corporate traffic? I seem to find this a lot in production networks I work on, and it seems to defy the logic of separating networks with VLANs. Could you expand upon the reasoning or benefit of using separate interfaces, or if its necessary at all given your experience? The thing I really don't get is these traffic flows meet on the switched network anyways, it is beyond me why someone would use two trunks vs a single trunk link in an Active / Active setup to separate traffic from WLC and the wireless network from the wired LAN? I will follow your blog here, look forward to your wireless posts, keep at it :)\nRyan - Aug 1, 2018\nHey Loopy, The benefit I see when using an separate interface for guest traffic is if you actually have a separate ISP for your guest network. If you are using the same network as internal people there's not really a reason to use another interface. Maybe if you are tapping out the bandwidth of that single trunk interface but that would probably be be the only reason for separation. Personally if I did not have an option to run a separate ISP for the guest network and I wasn't worried about bandwidth, I would just use a single interface until it becomes a problem with bandwidth. Thanks Ryan\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2018/04/16/wireless-vlans/","section":"post","tags":["802.11ax","Network","technology","vlans","wireless"],"title":"Wireless VLANs"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/lan/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"LAN"},{"body":"Let's start out 2018 with private VLANs, with PVLANs the network gets a little more privacy added to it. When we have privacy on the network we can seclude certain parts of it. Essentially, \u0026quot;you can go about your business - move along, move along\u0026quot;. Private VLANs allow us to segment networks within a single VLAN. So in this post we'll go over the types of PVLANs as well as setup a network topology with private VLANs, Let's get started!\nSo in order to have a private VLAN we have to create a normal VLAN. Which is also called a primary VLAN. Within that private VLAN we can configure it two different ways:\nIsolated private VLAN - Which is just what it sounds like, this type of VLAN is cut off from everything including hosts within that same isolated private VLAN. The only thing this VLAN can reach is the primary VLAN. Community private VLAN - Again just like the name sounds this type of VLAN can be grouped together with other members in the same private VLAN community. This enables members of the same community to be able to talk to each other in the same PVLAN. as well as being able to reach the primary VLAN. However these communities are isolated from each other so they can't talk to other private VLAN communities or isolated PVLANs. Once we have set up the type of private VLAN we want we have to configure the individual ports on the switch, remember we have to always associate these private VLANs with a primary VLAN. We configure this on the individual switch port. There are two different types of modes for these switch ports:\nPromiscuous - This type of switch port mode is usually used for a common gateway device because when in this mode this port can talk to anything in primary or secondary VLAN. Host - Like the name says it, This port only talks to other ports in the same community or to any promiscuous port that is associated with on the same private VLAN. This is usually used is used for connecting hosts to the network with a PVLAN. Let's look at an example of what the use case could be for using private VLANs. Acme Corp is getting into the hosting business and they have three customers/tenants so far, these three tenants are not related and these servers don't need to know about what else is on the network, they just need to connect to the internet through R1.\nEach PVLAN is a different \u0026quot;customer\u0026quot; and we have separated these servers with different private VLANs. These servers although they are on the same 10.0.0.0/24 network, they can't talk to each other. All servers can reach R1, servers that are in the same community PVLAN can reach each other as well. The configuration is pretty simple we have to create four (4) VLANs, in this example I have created VLANs 2, 3, 4, and 5. VLAN 2 is are primary VLAN and we are associating VLANs 3, 4 and 5 within VLAN 2.\n1SW1(config)# vlan 2 2SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan primary 3SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan association 3-5 Next we have to tell the switch which PVLANs are community PVLANs and which ones are isolated. In this example VLAN three (3) is an isoloated PVLAN. Where PVLANs four (4) and five (5) are community private VLANs\n1SW1(config)# vlan 3 2SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan isolated 3SW1(config-vlan)# exit 4SW1(config)# vlan 4 5SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan community 6SW1(config-vlan)# exit 7SW1(config)# vlan 5 8SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan community After that we have to go into the individual switch ports for each server and router. Starting with R1 we are mapping VLANs 3, 4, and 5 to this port and turning on promiscuous.

There could be situations where you have multiple hosts on the same LAN and want to block traffic from reaching certain hosts within that same network, how would you go about blocking that type of traffic without using a router or firewall? (Hint: Create a VACL)\nIn this post we have a DMZ and an INTERNAL network. The goal is to block DMZ systems from reaching other servers in the DMZ. We have are standard \u0026quot;out of the box\u0026quot; configuration firewall that is between the DMZ and INTERNAL network. In this example the firewall is configured with security-levels in place. The INTERNAL zone has a security-level of 100 and the DMZ zone as a security-level 80. We have two VLANs on this switch, VLAN two (2) which is the DMZ and VLAN three (3) which is the INTERNAL VLAN. The firewall is using the \u0026quot;router on a stick\u0026quot; configuration and trunking VLANs on the single interface, and we have four servers total. Two DMZ servers and two INTERNAL servers are in this example.\nThe INTERNAL servers can reach the DMZ servers, however the DMZ servers can't reach the INTERNAL systems which is expected because of the security-levels that are configured on the firewall. However the DMZ servers can reach other, to disable that we need to create an ACL on the switch before we create a VACL :)\n1ip access-list extended BLK-DMZ-COMS permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 This extended ACL is used to identify the source and destination traffic that we want to block. In this example this ACL matches DMZ servers talking to other DMZ servers in the 192.168.2.0/24 network. Next we have to build a VLAN access map, in this example I'm calling it \u0026quot;VACL-BLK-DMZ-COMS\u0026quot;.\n1vlan access-map VACL-BLK-DMZ-COMS 10 match ip address BLK-DMZ-COMS action drop This VLAN access map matches the IP address in our ACL that we created as well as the action to take if a match is successful. However just like ACLs VLANs access-maps have an implicit deny so we need to add another entry to the access map to allow everything else.\n1vlan access-map VACL-BLK-DMZ-COMS 20 action forward The final thing is to apply this VACL that we just created to the VLAN we want this VACL to apply enforce, which would be VLAN 2.\n1vlan filter VACL-BLK-DMZ-COMS vlan-list 2 That's it! We have just enabled this VACL onto VLAN 2, the DMZ servers can no longer talk to each other. Our internal systems can still reach both of the DMZ systems just like we wanted. I hope this information is helpful,\nIf you are using Cisco VIRL here is a link on GitHub to the file I was working with.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2017/11/20/vlan-access-lists-vacls/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","LAN","Network","Security","technology","VACL","VLAN"],"title":"VLAN Access Lists (VACLs)"},{"body":"So what has changed in the past 20 years? Take for example the network equipment that was manufactured in 1997, how did you configure that equipment? I would imagine it involved a serial port, HyperTerminal and trusty command line. Was API even a thing back in 1997, was it common to have an API interface in network equipment like today? Why do we even need an API on the equipment in the first place? What changed? Well the year isn't 1997 anymore, that past us 20 years ago and the equipment we work with today looks and operates much differently than it did in 1997.\nWe work in a world now that operates with Gbps/Tbps not Kbps/Mbps. With the need for speed CLI isn't the fastest thing anymore to configure or monitor network devices. This industry is moving into automated ways to configure and monitor network devices. So in this post we'll look at enabling the NX-API that's in the Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 family switches, and in foing this we'll get introduced into the Cisco NX-API sandbox.\nTo enable this API jump right into CLI and configure the management interface, we'll be able to use this API using the management IP address of the switch.\n1vrf context management 2interface mgmt0 3 description OOB Management 4 vrf member management 5 ip address 172.16.1.192/24 Once the management interface is configured we now can enable the NX-API by one command.\n1nx-osv9000-1# config t 2nx-osv9000-1(config)# feature nxapi Open a web browser to the management IP address and login with a username and password. Welcome to NX-API Sandbox! With this we can play around to get a further understanding of how to use this API. Like being able to configure and or monitor this device with either a custom home-grown system, or the use some network automation software like Puppet or Chef. So now what? Well if you are like me and really don't have much programming experience or just enough to be dangerous this where you get comfortable and use this sandbox to understand what it can and cannot do. For example on the upper right hand side, if I select XML on the message format, then cli_show on the command type, followed by typing the command show hostname in the CLI command box, and finishing by selecting the post button, I should see an output of an XML request as well as the XML response from the switch.\n1\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;ins_api\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;cli_show\u0026lt;/type\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.0\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;sid\u0026gt;eoc\u0026lt;/sid\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;outputs\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;output\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 9 \u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;nx-osv9000-1\u0026lt;/hostname\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 11 \u0026lt;input\u0026gt;show hostname\u0026lt;/input\u0026gt; 12 \u0026lt;msg\u0026gt;Success\u0026lt;/msg\u0026gt; 13 \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;200\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; 14 \u0026lt;/output\u0026gt; 15 \u0026lt;/outputs\u0026gt; 16\u0026lt;/ins_api\u0026gt; Note: Sandbox is a loose term here as any configuration viewed or applied is live on the equipment, don't play in the sandbox on production equipment. :)\nThis post just scratches the surface of what you could do with this API, being able to either write something yourself or using third-party software to help configure and maintain network equipment makes your job easier. Although we still have equipment and even people today that still like those three letters \u0026quot;CLI\u0026quot;, being able to use an API that can configure and maintain provides options for these devices, and who doesn't like that?\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2017/10/18/enable-the-nx-os-api/","section":"post","tags":["API","Cisco","cisco","Network","Nexus","technology"],"title":"Enable the NX-OS API"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/nexus/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Nexus"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cli/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"CLI"},{"body":"You have the FMC installed and connect to FTD device with configuration deployed but for what ever reason there is a problem and you need to enter the CLI on the Firepower device to troubleshoot the equipment and although you can't configure anything you can do show and debug commands to troubleshoot via the CLI.

Although this works well we now have hardware powered-on and just sitting around waiting for its counterpart to fail, we are not actively using it. We could split up networks or use multiple default gateways within the same network but who does that? Well if your router or layer three switch happens to have that Cisco logo on it and a software release of at least 12.2(14)S, please welcome and \u0026quot;slow clap\u0026quot; the Gateway Load Balancing protocol, who has been around since 2002!\nSo the way this protocol works is you must have at least two devices (makes sense) in a GLBP group. The GLBP group has one AVG (Active Virtual Gateway) and multiple AVFs (Active Virtual Forwarders) if you have more than two devices. The AVG is the master of the group and assigns virtual MAC address to each AVF member. Remember each AVF is responsible for forwarding packets sent to their virtual MAC address, they act independently from the AVG.\nNote: The AVG is also an AVF When a PC/server makes an ARP request to reach the default gateway each router in the GLBP group share the load by default one client will get a MAC address from one router, while the other client will get an address from another router but both clients point to the same IP address for the default gateway.\nIn this example I have two different GLBP networks, the 192.168.1.0/24 and the 192.168.2.0/24 with three routers in each LAN. I also have a routing protocol running between the routers (Named EIGRP) to better handle the multiple paths as well as recover from failed links.\nTo configure GLBP let's start on the 192.168.1.0/24 network, we have to configure the following on each router that belongs to the 192.168.1.0/24, which would be R1, R2, and R3, this configuration is under the interface that belongs to the 192.168.1.0/24 network.

In this example we want R1 the AVG, R2 and R3 are backup AVGs. We also want to do the same thing for R4, R5, and R6 with R4 the AVG, R5 and R6 backup AVGs.

Next, you need to evaluate to the root account by using sudo su SCP copy the update to the /var/sf/updates folder, you can either copy from the FMC or something else that has the update you are looking for. 1scp admin@192.168.1.5:/image.sh /var/sf/updates If the update is on the FMC the path is /var/sf/updates and it would look something like this, we are pulling from the FMC and copying to the sensor to /var/sf/updates folder.\n1scp admin@192.168.1.5:/var/sf/updates/Cisco/FTD/Patch-6.2.0.2-51.sh /var/sf/updates Install the update via install_update.pl /var/sf/updates/image.sh and watch the console when the upgrade completes your sensor will reboot and no action is needed on the FMC it will automatically detect the new version.\nBelow is an omitted copy of the console output when upgrading Cisco Firepower devices, keep in mind this session has to stay active don't close or disconnect while updating, let's just say hitting CTRL+C during this process is an instant killjoy, and although it can be fixed I wouldn't advise it!\n1\u0026gt; expert 2admin@host-172-16-1-110:~$ sudo su 3 4We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System 5Administrator.

","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2017/07/12/update-firepower-devices-manually/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","Firepower","FTD","Network","technology"],"title":"Update Firepower Devices - Manually"},{"body":"Cisco is actively pushing their Firepower Threat Defense software with the new Firepower 2100 units on their way this summer in effort to eventually replace the ASA5525-X, ASA5545-X and ASA5555-X platforms. When using FTD you must also have the Firepower Management Center (FMC) available to manage and configure these devices. This gets difficult especially if you want to test things out because not everyone has Cisco Firepower lying around unused. How are you supposed to test and learn the depths of this product? (Hint: Cisco VIRL)\nNote: There is a catch to this, as of this post Cisco does not included the FMC or FTDv images with Cisco VIRL by itself. You’ll have to be with a company or organization that has already purchased this product. Keep in mind during the initial configuration of FMC there will be a spot to install some licensing but you can skip this step as it's not required to get to the initial login screen. The images I’m working with in this post are the following:\nFMC: 6.2.0.2 (updated from 6.2.0) FTDv: 6.2.0 To understand how this is works, you must setup the FMC as a separate virtual machine in VMware Workstation and configure a static IP address for the FMC. You’ll want to use an IP address that is in VIRL’s shared flat network. This is usually the 172.16.1.0/24 network. In this example, I configured the FMC with the IP address of 172.16.1.15. If you have installed VIRL in VMware Workstation and followed the VIRL installation guide you’ll want to put the FMC in VMnet 1. Basically, you’ll want the FMC and FTDv to be on the same broadcast domain in the management network within VIRL for your FMC to be able to manage the FTDv image. If you are using VIRL on a bare metal server and have VMware Workstation installed on a different system use VIRL’s OpenVPN connection settings. To understand how this works you can reference the following video (Credit goes to Cisco VIRL Youtube Channel):\nOnce your computer has the OpenVPN client installed and you can successfully connect to VIRL, you also can map VMware Workstation to the OpenVPN network adapter under the virtual network editor. This gives your FMC direct access to VIRL’s shared flat network while using the OpenVPN client. Please reference the Cisco Firepower Management Center Virtual for VMware Deployment Quick Start Guide\nThe process in pretty simple login into the FMC CLI and run the following command and follow the prompts.\n1sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/configure-network If all is well you should see the initial configuration wizard, and once you have completed the initial setup wizard you should be able to login using the password you recently created.\nYou now have a FMC ready and primed to manage FTDv devices, like I mention earlier you can enable the evaluation license which is only available in the 6.2.0 or higher releases. Go to System-\u0026gt;Licenses-\u0026gt;Smart Licenses which gives you 90 days to kick in the tires.\nNote: You also could use VMware snapshots to set up a vanilla FMC with no devices, and no evaluation license enabled, that way you could always revert to that FMC you originally started with, also helps if you really got carried away :)\nWe now need a FTDv image to install within VIRL. When you look at Cisco's support download page you'll want to use the QEMU format (qcow2) if you are importing this into Cisco VIRL. A couple of house keeping items first before we can import this:\nFirst: Create a flavor to specify run time parameters in VIRL, you can find this under Node Resources-\u0026gt;Flavors. FTDv requires 8GB of RAM, 4 virtual CPU cores and 4 interfaces to run, this includes the Management and Diagnostic ports that VIRL puts in automatically. You can also leave disk space at 0\nSecond: Create a copy of the ASAv subtype, under Node Resources-\u0026gt;Subtypes, find the ASAv subtype and click on the “stethoscope” icon also called specialize and fill in the following:\nName of plugin - FTDv\nDescription of plugin - Firepower Threat Defense\nName of management interface - Management0/0\nNames of dummy interfaces - Diagnostic0/0\nPattern for data interface names - GigabitEthernet0/{0}\nFirst data interface number - 0\nMax count of data interfaces - 10\nNumber of interfaces per LC - 0\nNumber of serial interfaces - 1\nProtocol for network CLI - telnet\nMake VNC access available - True\nName of icon for GUI - asav\nShow subtype on GUI palette - True\nConfiguration disk type - cdrom\nISO 9660 level in cdrom disk - 4\nName of file for config drive - /day0-config\nVirtual interface model - virtio\nMain disk bus model - virtio\nRAM (MB) allocated per node - 8192\nNumber of CPUs allocated per node - 4\nRequire HW acceleration in kvm - True\nName of default image - FTDv\nThird: Import the image, Node Resources-\u0026gt;Images-\u0026gt;Add:\nFind and select the FTDv Subtype Name/Version – 6.2 (I just picked the main version) Release - 6.2.0 Source – File on server Image path – /home/virl/VMs/image of FTDv image Save the image. We are almost there!\nTo review we have a FMC ready, we have the evaluation license enabled so that we can manage FTDv devices and this FMC is statically configured to use an IP address that is in VIRL's shared flat network. We just went over the settings required to get the FTDv to boot up in Cisco VIRL.\nSo what's next? Well if you wanted to register and configure the FTDv manually you are all set to go just start-up the device and you can walk through the initial prompts to get it registered to the FMC and start deploying your configurations. However one the neat features that VIRL offers is pre-configuration of the device while the device starts up, also called Day0 configuration. That way you can to skip all of those initial prompts and just register the device from FMC when the FTDv image is fully booted. To do that you will be using the AutoNetKit in VM Maestro, use the following Day0 configuration before starting your FTDv image.\n1{ 2\u0026#34;EULA\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;accept\u0026#34;, 3\u0026#34;Hostname\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ftdv-VIRL\u0026#34;, 4\u0026#34;AdminPassword\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Admin123\u0026#34;, 5\u0026#34;FirewallMode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;routed\u0026#34;, 6\u0026#34;DNS1\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, 7\u0026#34;DNS2\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, 8\u0026#34;DNS3\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, 9\u0026#34;IPv4Mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dhcp\u0026#34;, 10\u0026#34;IPv4Addr\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 11\u0026#34;IPv4Mask\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 12\u0026#34;IPv4Gw\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 13\u0026#34;IPv6Mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;disabled\u0026#34;, 14\u0026#34;IPv6Addr\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 15\u0026#34;IPv6Mask\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 16\u0026#34;IPv6Gw\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 17\u0026#34;FmcIp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;172.16.1.15\u0026#34;, 18\u0026#34;FmcRegKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cisco1234\u0026#34;, 19\u0026#34;FmcNatId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; 20} The fields are pretty self-explanatory the only thing that could be different is if you used a different FMC IP and registration key. When the image boots it will grab an IP address from VIRL's shared network and already be pending a registration. The only thing you have to do is register your device from FMC and deploy your configuration. This now makes it pretty easy and quickly to test deployments and configuration within VIRL. In my testing it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the FTDv device to become online and to be registered within FMC. That's all I got for now like always I hope this information helpful as alawys!\nStatic Comments: Shaun - Jul 4, 2017\nFigured it out, just needed to select the topology management network to be in the Shared Flat network. This has helped me out tremendously, thank you.\nShaun - Jul 3, 2017\nHow and which interface did you use to get the FTDv working on the FLAT network? Can you show a working sample topology you used?\nkarmicgeezer - Jan 8, 2018\nMany thanks for the tutorial - when I follow this I consistently get the same issue: Virtual FTD requires at least 4 network interfaces to complete system initialization. System initialization in progress. Please stand by. The bar turns but will sit there indefinitely. Any ideas?\nRyan - Jan 9, 2018\nHey Karmicgeezer, That is expected. You can't just run the VM without it connected to anything in VIRL. Make sure your subtype in VIRL has a management and diagnostic interface. You also have to connect up to two interfaces on the FTDv in VIRL in order for it to start correctly. Hope that Helps, Ryan\nkarmicgeezer - Jan 9, 2018\nRyan, Fantastic, this would explain why it works natively in ESXi but not deployed in VIRL without sufficient interfaces. Much appreciated!! All the best, Andy\nRyan - Jan 9, 2018\nGlad I could help Andy!

The main purpose of EIGRP was to overcome the limitations of classful networks and make EIGRP a classless routing protocol. During designing of this protocol a different convergence algorithm was used making EIGRP that \u0026quot;hybrid\u0026quot; between distance-vector and link-state routing protocols. In this post we'll go over a basic design and setup for EIGRP, however instead of using the \u0026quot;classic way\u0026quot; let's look at configuring EIGRP using named mode which is available in Cisco IOS starting in version 15.2\nThis topology is pretty simple, I have three routers and each them is connected to the other two routers.\nAll routers have been setup with their local addresses and can ping any network that is locally attached to them. There are two ways to configure EIGRP we could configure it the \u0026quot;classic way\u0026quot; or use named mode. Nothing has changed with EIGRP itself so you could have one router use classic and another router use named mode and the protocol would exchange routing information between the two. The change is to simplify the configuration into one spot, which is under the router EIGRP process instead of having some EIGRP configuration under each interface.

We can instead use a standard internet connection with a static IP, this is usually cheaper than a dedicated circuit. Our next steps are purchasing a firewall for the remote site (assuming you already have one at HQ) and setup a site to site VPN connection to make the connection. In this guide, I’ll demo a site to site VPN with a pair of ASAs as well as some additional commands to allow DHCP across the tunnel so that your HQ DHCP server can hand out addresses instead of configuring a local DHCP server at the remote site.\nThe table below goes over the agreed settings and what networks are protected. Also note that the “public” IP addresses listed in this example are from RFC 5737 and are not publicly available.

(Port Address Translation) besides using this to connect to the internet when using an RFC 1918 address, you can configure PAT for VPN connections. The benefit is the same, hide multiple systems behind a single IP address with the advantage being you can have many systems on one side of the VPN tunnel all using that single IP.\nIn this example, we have a site to site VPN connection one side using a PATed public IP address. We originally have two systems that will be sending data over to Contoso who is the remote peer in this example. We are planning on adding additional systems in the future which is why Acme Corp is using a PATed address outbound. Contoso is expected to send data back to Acme Corp which will also be reflected in this example. Also note that the \u0026quot;public\u0026quot; IP addresses listed in this example are from RFC 5737 and are not publicly available. We have a need to setup a VPN to a partner and have agreed using a public IP address over the VPN connection.

This gives VIRL additional flexibly by being able to run third-party VMs with KVM begin the hypervisor. In this guide I’ll walk through some of the steps I took to get Windows XP up and running in VIRL. :) If you have a more recent version of Windows that's in the current decade following this guide is pretty much the same just adjust the disk space and RAM to fit the requirements. I picked Windows XP is because its light weight, and with an average RAM usage under 100MB it makes easy to add multiple instances if you needed all without wasting too much resources on VIRL host. To get started:\nYou’ll need to have a copy of Windows XP. I also found an unofficial service pack for Windows XP SP4 (unofficial) - Optional Copy of the Windows Virtio Drivers from Fedora. (VFD Floppy image when installing Windows XP on KVM) I’m running Cisco VIRL 1.2.83 on bare metal for this example, but this would also work if VIRL is virtualized. Let’s first edit the nova.conf file in VIRL, we need change a value in the nova configuration file which helps us control the mouse better when we use VNC to view the virtual machine in VIRL.\n1nano /etc/nova/nova.conf Find use_usb_tablet = False and change it to use_usb_tablet = True save the changes, and restart VIRL.\nOnce VIRL comes back up we now need to create folder under the home/virl directory to store our Windows XP installation, drivers and the virtual machine, I’m calling it VMs in this example. Once the folder is created move into that folder using terminal and type the following:\n1sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 wsxp-SP3.qcow2 15G This will create a virtual disk in qcow2 format and the size will be 15G, this next command will create all the necessary settings needed to start the installation of Windows.\n1sudo virt-install --connect qemu:///system --name wsxp-SP3 --ram 512 --vcpus 1 --network network=default,model=virtio --disk path=/home/virl/VMs/wsxp-SP3.qcow2,format=qcow2,device=disk,bus=virtio --cdrom /home/virl/VMs/xp.iso --disk path=/home/virl/VMs/virtio-win.vfd,device=floppy --vnc --os-type windows --os-variant winxp Please make sure to verify the paths are correct per your system. I’m mounting the XP installation ISO as well as the floppy disk so that I can install the drivers needed for Windows to recognize the hard drive. Open virt-manager to see your Windows XP virtual machine it should already be on so you will want to walk through the steps to complete the installation.\nDuring the installation and when installing drivers, you will get a couple of warnings about how the software drivers have not passed logo testing ignore this and continue to install it.\nOnce you have Windows installed you can mount your virtio drivers that you downloaded and install the remaining drivers needed for Windows XP as well as any programs you would like to have available when you spin up this VM. Wireshark (Version 1.10.14), and 3cdaemon are just a couple of examples for software you could use.\nOnce you have all the programs you want to go ahead and prepare a sysprep image using your XP installation ISO file. Open the deploy.cab file which is under the SUPPORT\\TOOLS folder, copy it into a new directory called SYSPREP on the C drive and extract the cabinet file. Once these files have been copied, turn off the VM and clone it. That way if you need to make any changes to the VM you can use your original VM. Once the machine turns off after the sysprep you now have an image you can import into VIRL. For reference on how to Sysprep Windows XP I followed this guide: http://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0000599\nYou’ll want to use that cloned image when you import this into VIRL because it will be a “new” machine every time it is launched from VIRL including the hostname if you configured the sysprep.Inf file correctly. The finished product should be something like what I have below, you shouldn’t have to do anything but wait a couple of minutes for an XP VM and if you configured DHCP on your routers in VIRL your machine will get an IP address automatically.\nTo import this VM into VIRL go into the User Workspace Management within in VIRL. We are going to create copy of a subtype. Under Node Resources-\u0026gt;Subtypes, find the generic subtype and click on the \u0026quot;stethoscope\u0026quot; icon also called specialize and fill in the following:\nSubtype - Windows Desciption of plugin - VM of Windows Pattern for data interface names - eth{0} First data interface number - 0 Max count of data interfaces - 5 Number of interface per LC - 0 Number of serial interfaces - 0 Protocol for network CLI - none Make VNC access available - (Checked) Name of icon for GUI - unknow Show subtype on GUI palette (unchecked) Configuration disk type - disk ISO 9660 level in cdrom disk - 2 Virtual interface model - virtio Main disk bus model - ide RAM (MB) allocter per node - 512 Number of CPUs allocated per node - 1 Name of default image - Windows-XPSP3 Create the subtype. Once the subtype is created go to Node Resources-\u0026gt;Images-\u0026gt;Add:\nFind and select the Windows Subtype Release - 5.1 (I just picked the Windows NT version) Source - File on server Image path - /home/virl/VMs/image of xp clone Create the image. Once the image has been created you now have imported Windows XP within VIRL and should be able to launch it within VM Maestro. You can take similar steps and import additional VMs like Juniper, Palo Alto, and Fortinet are just some examples more information how to import those and other are on 3rd Party VMs in VIRL page on the Cisco Learning Network. I hope this information is helpful, Ryan.\nStatic Comments: Configuring EIGRP – Named Mode – Cisco Skills - May 4, 2017\n[…] That’s all I got for now for a basic configuration of EIGRP name mode and I hope this helpful.

Talking with our VAR because we where planning on connecting in additional equipment that only supported SFP+ interfaces. So the solution was to connect to this switch with QSFP to SFP+ adapters.\nThinking this would be a simple change because we are just plugging in additional adapters on the QSFP ports we planned our maintenance window and rollback plans but I wasn't expecting a rollback for this one :) The interfaces were configured in a shutdown status before we plugged in the adapters and cables so didn't see anything out of the ordinary, when it was time to do the maintenance let's bring up the interfaces with the command of no shutdown and we should be up...\nWell not exactly, I first thought it was the other end so I checked that and its reporting the link is down but it was not in a shutdown status. Looking at the Nexus switch interface I see the words \u0026quot;check speed-group config\u0026quot; under the interface and its in a err-disable status and I'll be honest I haven't worked with interfaces that are speed-grouped together so I didn't know that it was even a thing. A quick search to see if I could \u0026quot;break\u0026quot; the speed-group and configure interfaces individually on their own speed turned up nothing.\nWe ended up doing a rollback which looked pretty ridiculous because these where just interfaces we couldn't bring online. It become apparent that I was stuck because with the equipment we had I couldn't use that 40Gbps uplink, the hardware only supported one speed for all six ports, hence the name \u0026quot;speed-group\u0026quot;. We would have to downgrade the link 10Gbps and then we would be able to connect in our additional gear. It's this kind of stuff where planning out for growth and understanding your hardware limits becomes very important, I didn't catch it because I have never heard of such thing and our VAR didn't catch it either. In this case we weren't maxing out that 40Gbps link and we could afford a downgrade in speed in the meantime. Others may not be so lucky and this could be a problem if you really needed that 40Gbps link or only had 40Gbps on your upstream switches. In the end don't get stuck with speed-groups! :)\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2016/12/21/dont-get-stuck-with-speed-groups/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","Network","Nexus","technology"],"title":"Don't get stuck with \"speed-groups\""},{"body":"I got my hands on some Cisco Firepower 4100 units and after playing around with them I wanted to reset them to factory settings, essentially erase the \u0026quot;startup-config\u0026quot; on the FXOS.

Ryan\nRyan - Nov 3, 2016\nHey Jimmy, I have not had experience upgrading to the FTD image for the ASAs and from what I can tell you may have to upgrade/download several things. I found this on Cisco website which may be a good starting point: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/quick_start/reimage/asa-ftd-reimage.html I have worked with the Firepower 4100 units which give you the option to use either ASA or an FTD image. I have been playing around with the FTD image and the ASA SFR module, they are different you really don't manage the device directly, it all works through the Firepower Management Center. Its interesting you're not having any luck with the filtering make sure if you are using the ASA image that you set up a service policy under the global policy to inspect all traffic with the SFR module and its not in monitor mode. You will also need to setup policies and rules in the FMC to block this type of traffic. Hope that helps :) Ryan\nanon - Jul 3, 2017\nYou should update your post at the top with this advice.

Create the FileServerRoot Folder as well as a sub folder under it called TFTP:\n1mkdir /var/FileServerRoot 2mkdir /var/FileServerRoot/TFTP Apply ownership for the TFTP system account:\n1chown tftp:tftp /var/FileServerRoot/TFTP/ Permissions should already be rwxr-xr-x for this directory. Next open up the configuration file for the TFTP server located at /etc/xinetd.d/tftp and following the example configuration file below:\n1nano /etc/xinetd.d/tftp 2# default: off 3# description: The tftp server serves files using the trivial file transfer \\ 4# protocol. The tftp protocol is often used to boot diskless \\ 5# workstations, download configuration files to network-aware printers, \\ 6# and to start the installation process for some operating systems. 7service tftp 8{ 9 socket_type = dgram 10 protocol = udp 11 wait = yes 12 user = root 13 server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd 14 server_args = -c -s /var/FileServerRoot/TFTP -v -v -v -u tftp -p 15 disable = no 16 per_source = 11 17 cps = 100 2 18 flags = IPv4 19} If you are curious of what each server argument means you can take a look here at the man page for TFTP server. Restart both services for the TFTP server:\n1systemctl restart xinetd tftp So after that we have to run more command for SELinux to be happy and the best part is we DON'T turn it off! Right now we are able to download files from the TFTP server but we get a permission denied when we try to upload files. To fix that run this command:\n1chcon -t tftpdir\\_rw\\_t /var/FileServerRoot/TFTP We now have a functioning TFTP server, all files permissions in this folder should be no more than 664. Although it would work with full permissions TFTP isn't that secure to begin with, now onto installing the FTP server :)\nInstall FTP Server on Centos 7 Alight let's install the FTP server on Centos and include the FTP client just in case we want to test locally:\n1yum install vsftpd ftp Now let's start looking at the firewall settings, and configuration settings to make this FTP anonymous for both uploads and downloads. Add an FTP rule to firewall and reload it:\n1firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=ftp 2firewall-cmd --reload Enable the vsftpd to startup apon boot:\n1systemctl enable vsftpd Let's create the FTP folder and in this example its going to be under the FileServerRoot we created earlier with TFTP or if you skiped the TFTP installation just create a Root directory first followed by creating the FTP folder.\n1mkdir /var/FileServerRoot 2mkdir /var/FileServerRoot/FTP We have to change permissions on the FTP folder to the following:\n1chmod 555 /var/FileServerRoot/FTP\\ We are also going to make two more folders under the FTP folder called upload and download to keep things organized:\n1mkdir /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/upload 2mkdir /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/download Change ownership of these folder to the FTP account which is built in:\n1chown ftp:ftp /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/upload 2chown ftp:ftp /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/download Let's make a backup of the configuration file that runs FTP (Just in case)\n1cp /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.orig Open up the configuration file with nano at /etc/vsftpq/vsftpd.conf and make the following edits towards the top of the file:\n1# Allow anonymous FTP? (Beware - allowed by default if you comment this out). 2anonymous_enable=YES 3# 4# Uncomment this to allow local users to log in. 5# When SELinux is enforcing check for SE bool ftp_home_dir 6local_enable=NO 7# 8# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command. 9write_enable=YES 10# 11# Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022, 12# if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd\u0026#39;s) 13local_umask=022 14# 15# Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only 16# has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will 17# obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user. 18# When SELinux is enforcing check for SE bool allow_ftpd_anon_write, allow_ftpd_full_access 19anon_upload_enable=YES 20# At the end of file put the following:\n1# Point users at the Public directory 2anon_root=/var/FileServerRoot/FTP/ 3# 4# Stop prompting for a password on the command line. 5no_anon_password=YES 6# 7# Show the user and group as ftp:ftp, regardless of the owner. 8hide_ids=YES 9# 10# Limit the range of ports that can be used for passive FTP 11pasv_min_port=40000 12pasv_max_port=50000 We are almost done we have to make some changes to SELinux before we are good to go. We have to install Policy Core Utils:\n1yum install policycoreutils-python We are now making changes to SELinux to allow anonymous downloads:\n1semanage fcontext -a -t public\\_content\\_t \u0026#34;/var/FileServerRoot/FTP(/.\\*)?\u0026#34; Next command to run:\n1restorecon -R -v /var/FileServerRoot/FTP -Output -\n1restorecon reset /var/FileServerRoot/FTP context unconfined_u:object_r:var_t:s0-\u0026amp;gt;unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_t:s0 2restorecon reset /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/upload context unconfined_u:object_r:var_t:s0-\u0026amp;gt;unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_t:s0 3restorecon reset /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/download context unconfined_u:object_r:var_t:s0-\u0026amp;gt;unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_t:s0 Now let's make changes to SELinux to allow anonymous uploads:\n1semanage fcontext -a -t public\\_content\\_rw\\_t \u0026#34;/var/FileServerRoot/FTP/upload(/.\\*)?\u0026#34; Next command to run:\n1restorecon -R -v /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/upload -Output -\n1restorecon reset /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/upload context unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_t:s0-\u0026amp;gt;unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_rw_t:s0 One more command to run:\n1semanage boolean -m --on allow\\_ftpd\\_anon\\_write\\ That should be it! Let's restart the server to make sure everything comes back online including the TFTP part that we finished earlier.\n1shutdown -r now If you have a TFTP and FTP client go ahead and test it out when the server reboots. If you run into some issues some troubleshooting tips are:\nCheck SELinux, if you are getting file permissions errors when uploading or downloading and permissions look this is likely SELinuix. It it can be a little picky which is why you'll read a lot of people just disable it. You can disable SELinux Temporarily (Turns back on when you reboot) to check if TFTP or FTP works by running 1setenforce 0 If you are having problems with anonymous FTP, like downloading or uploading check security context by running: 1ls -Z For FTP to work the context output should like something below: 1[root@localhost ~]# ls -Z /var/FileServerRoot/FTP/ 2drwxr-xr-x. ftp ftp unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_t:s0 download 3drwxr-xr-x. ftp ftp unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_rw_t:s0 upload 4[root@localhost ~]# Keep in mind we just created a system that is open to any TFTP and FTP connection. Reads and writes are anonymous so if there is a need to control what/who can access your server over your network/internet its recommended to in put ACLs in place to block unwanted connections. Otherwise you might be on list like this one, in which the entire IPv4 address space was scanned to find what responds anonymously on TCP port 21.

I don't know when I want to start that but it'll probably be sooner rather than later. It's been a little more than five years of when I passed my first Cisco certification.

The Cisco UCS emulator is a VM you can spin up in VMware Workstation,Fusion or in ESXi. This emulator can be helpful in understanding the UCS platform and UCS manager. You are able to push policies and alter configurations and even import/export these configurations into and out of the \u0026quot;real\u0026quot; world to apply them/test them.\nYou can download this emulator from Cisco's Community site: Cisco UCS Platform Emulator 3.1(1ePE1) Downloads All you need is a Cisco ID to sign in which is free to register and download. Its pretty easy to set up if you are deploying and OVA once the VM is online you just browse to the IP address of the VM . Watch the console of the VM for the IP address and it does take 5 to 10 minutes to boot up before you can hit the emulator. When the system boots it'll look for a DHCP server if your setup does not have DHCP you can manually add an IP address from the console screen. Follow the prompts its pretty easy to figure out, once you have a valid IP address you can just type that into your browser. You should see the UCS Platform Emulator. This is where you can modify your hardware before going into the UCS Manager. UCS Platform Emulator To login into the UCS manager, I'm using the defualt username and password which is ucspe this is also the same username and password to login into the console of the them VM. Be sure to check out the release notes and user guide information on how to set this up if you need more information.\nI hope this information is helpful, I'm pretty green to UCS (still a rookie) but this emulator should at least help with some hands on learning with the product just in case you don't have any real UCS hardware.

Why is that? Is part of the reason because of the rapid push that applications are demanding from the infrastructure? For example if we want XYZ app to be ready for testing today and production in a week how would you be able to stand that up manually? You can't, it really could take weeks to be ready for just testing and that doesn't fly anymore.\nSo what we doing to speed things up? We're focusing less on the common office apps like email, Instant Messaging, in house file servers and moving all of this to the cloud and paying for it like a utility bill. We are adding layers of abstraction on manual tasks and calling it automation. Openstack, Docker and SDN all have a common theme, abstract the complexity into a one-two-click solution. It sounds great on paper but what happens when it fails? You now have just increased the complexity of the solution that was suppose to help/hide the complexity in the first place.\nThings get worse if nobody really knows what this does, how does it work, and how can I fix it? Couple of months ago Google had an issue with its compute engine instances where it lost external connectivity because of automated systems removed all BGP external IP blocks, this was due to software bug. More information. Networks are becoming more complex, and the need to have things spin up and down are now very important to an organization but there needs to be balance between how many layers of abstraction you have and just overall of functionally it.\nI don't have a problem with automation and the abstracting of layers, I think its a great idea because it this helps us become efficient, competitive and overall it does work, honestly we don't really have a choice in the end because the industry is moving into that direction anyway. We have to be aware of how many abstraction layers there are between the bare metal equipment and you, We can't have Inception automation...but I still consider my self a rookie, I haven't been is this industry for that long so maybe I'm missing something.\nI have been little quiet this summer, I have had some changes with my career and so far so good. I hope this information above is helpful. Let me know what you think, also enjoy the new look of the website. I seem to change this website layout around every couple of years.

In this demo I already have this NPS system connected to a Windows domain, my goal is to create role based access on Cisco IOS routers while using radius to login. I’ll have a couple for active directory accounts each them will represent different types of allowed access to these IOS routers. One account will get full administrative access while the other will only get read access, how cool cat is that ;)\nWe have to get some house-cleaning things done first before we jump into it. To keep this simple in this example I'm only using one router and this router is able to reach the radius server. I’ll have to create an enable secret on the device, create a local username with a password, and turn AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting). I like to create my own AAA method lists one for the console logins and one for remote logins here is what I got so far:\n1enable secret 0 cisco 2username admin privilege 15 secret 0 cisco 3aaa new-model 4aaa authentication login OPEN-CONSOLE none 5aaa authentication login RADIUS-LOCAL group radius local-case 6aaa authorization exec default group radius if-authenticated The router needs to know where radius server is located, we also need to put in a radius key and this needs to match between both the router and radius server.\n1radius server RADIUS 2address ipv4 192.168.5.10 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 3key cisco123 If our router has more than one active interface we also should specify which IP interface we want the radius information to come from. In this example GigabitEthernet 0/1 will be the source interface.\n1ip radius source-interface GigabitEthernet0/1 Apply this AAA method to the console and VTY ports:\n1line con 0 login authentication OPEN-CONSOLE exit 2line vty 0 4 login authentication RADIUS-LOCAL The magic begins with the Microsoft NPS server although any radius server is just as magical. We first have to create our client list within the Microsoft NPS. I have just used the defaults and have kept note of the radius key we configured earlier. This is pretty simple, expand the Radius Clients and Servers folder and right-click on Radius Clients and select new.\nA new window will show, populate the information with a friendly name of the device you wish to add, IP address of the device and the radius key. After that select OK.\nNOTE: Make sure the address matches to what you have configured as the source-interface on the router in this example it was GigabitEthernet0/1.\nOnce we have the all the clients in the client list we can now go to the Connection Request Polices. I usually just delete the existing policy, Use Windows authentication for all users and create a new policy called Radius-Login. Right-click on the Connection Request Policy folder, select new and follow these steps:\nAdd a policy name and click next. Add a condition, (I usually do a a day and time condition and select the time frame you want logins to occur. Select next. Accept the defaults, Authenticate requests on this server, select next. Don't override anything, select next Leave the defaults which is blank on everything, select next. At the Connection Request Policy summary page it should look like something like below, select finish. Go to the Network Policy Folder you will see some policies already created, delete those policies. We are going to create our own and the first policy is going to be a Network Administrators policy which will give full access to the IOS router if the user belongs to the correct Windows Security group. Right-click on the Network Policy folder and select new, new window will appear. Type in the policy name. In this example I'm using Allow Network Administrators - Administrative Access, select next. Under conditions select User Groups and in this example I have already created a security group on the Windows directory called Network Administrators, select next. On the following screen grant access and select next as well.\nIn the Authentication Methods clear the following check-boxes and select the Unencrypted Authentication (PAP, SPAP), select next and disregard the warning. On the following screen Configure Constraints accept the defaults select next.\nWe should be at the Configure Settings page, under the Radius Attributes delete the existing attributes and add Service-Type Administrative.\nUnder Vendor Specific we need to add to a Cisco-AV Pair to tell the router to go to privilege level 15, select next when you add the shell:priv-lvl=15 in the Cisco-AV.\nYou are now at the summary page and it should pretty similar to what I have below, select Finish!\nYou have now just created your first radius network policy. If all is well and if you have a user in Windows Security group you should be able to login into the router via radius. In this example I was able to login into the HQ router with my Windows active directory username and password.\n1login as: ryan 2 3************************************************************************** 4* IOSv is strictly limited to use for evaluation, demonstration and IOS * 5* education.

How would we be able to do this with radius? Well with Cisco IOS you can use parser views, basically you configure a parser view on the IOS router call it name and configure the view to only allow the commands you want. You configure the radius server to pass the name of the parser view you created on the IOS router, if the parser view name matches the router will put that user into that view and only allow the user to use the commands that are configured in that view. More information about parser views can be found on Cisco website: Role-Based CLI Access So in this example we are going to create a parser view called SHOWMODE and only allow show commands. In the enable prompt we want to be in \u0026quot;root view mode\u0026quot; to do this we would type enable view, the router is going to be asking for a password and that is your enable secret password you created at the beginning of this post.\nNOTE: If you have Radius enabled you will have to at least disable the client in NPS when you are first configuring a parser view. By disabling the client in NPS the router will fail-back to its local database of username and passwords to authenticate. The reason for this is because the router will try to use the NPS server to authenticate, this may not sound like a problem but the router is not using your username when you issue the command enable view. If your radius server has logging enabled you'll see that the router is using a different username called root. Since root is not in our Windows Active Directory the radius server will reject the request. Although you could create a user called root in Windows Active directory and put that user in the correct security groups to allow logins using radius that just doesn't sound like a good idea. The simplest method is to disable the client in NPS and use your enable secret password. Give it a second or two as this has to timeout before it fails-back to the local username and password database.\n1login as: ryan 2 3************************************************************************** 4* IOSv is strictly limited to use for evaluation, demonstration and IOS * 5* education.

We only need to focus on the Vendor Specific section of the network policy under the radius attributes section. We need to add a different Cisco AV-Pair called shell:cli-view-name=SHOWMODE and also add the shell:priv-lvl=15.\nIt would look something like this, select next.\nWe now should be at the summary screen of the new policy we just created and to give you a reference here is what I have for this example.\nOnce we select finish we should be able to login to our router but this time it is going to be using the parser view we created.

We have created policies on Microsoft NPS server as well as created parser views to limit access based on user accounts and tied it all together using radius. I hope this this information is helpful in helping you build a better RBAC with your network devices!\nStatic Comments: Ryan - Feb 4, 2018\nHey Darkpenguin, Privilege levels are hierarchical where as parser views are role based, so they are two different things. I can specifically call out different commands to use under a parser view regardless if its at a lower or higher privilege level. If you look at the example where the username Joe logs into the router, although this account has privilege level 15 this account is tied to a parser view called SHOWMODE. This account could only do show commands regardless what the privilege level was set. I really don't need to worry about privilege levels if I'm using parser views, however you could give them a lower privilege level but I think the end result would be the same, they would only be able to use show commands on that lower privilege level. So I'm not sure what benefit you would get from putting this group at a lower privilege level.

You followed and installed Rancid, all the new stuff works like it should but when you try to connect to that “one-of-kind” 2811 with Rancid it closes the connection... :/\nThis is a simple fix and the bug is reported here: LINK. The bug is something with OpenSSH which is installed on your Linux operating system and Rancid rides on top of it. You would have the same issue if you just tried SSH to thing directly from your Rancid machine. The bug looked to be fixed starting OpenSSH 6.9 but as right now at least in Centos 7 the version it goes up to is OpenSSH 6.6. You can verify this by using sshd -V to output the OpenSSH version you are using.\nSimple fix is to modify the ssh_config file usually located at /etc/ssh/ssh_config and at the bottom of the file put the host you are connecting to. Copy what you have in your router.db file meaning if you are using DNS names put DNS names of the devices that won’t connect into this file. If you are using IP address use IP address in this file. In this example I’m using IP addresses and DNS names, the following is at the bottom of the ssh_config file:\n1# Custom Rancid Configuration (Issues with Connecting SSH with Older Devices) 2# Bug Report 740307 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=740307 3# 4Host 192.168.3.1 5 KexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 6# 7Host Router03.example.com 8 KexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 9# 10Host Router02.example.com 11 KexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 12# You should be good to go after that. You can test this by using clogin or by connecting directly. If you noticed on the bug report you could also up the Diffie-Hellman size to 4096 on the router itself by using the ip ssh dh min size 4096 command as well. I hope this helps if you ever need it :)\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2016/03/03/rancid-cant-ssh-to-older-isrs/","section":"post","tags":["CentOS","Cisco","ISR","networking","OpenSSH","Rancid","SSH"],"title":"Rancid can’t SSH to older ISRs?"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ssh/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"SSH"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/bandwidth/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"bandwidth"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/iperf/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"iperf"},{"body":"Testing a network’s throughput is a good move, if you are testing a new service you stood up or making sure you getting what you paid for. iPerf is good free open source tool when there isn’t really a need to use commercial more expensive tools.

If you have not used Graylog before then I encourage you to check it out. This is an open source log management system and is pretty flexible as it can capture, index and analyze almost anything. Once up and running this system can be scaled out for an enterprise wide log management system. High availability, clustered, and replicated is what Graylog thrives on. In this demo I am going to have two systems. One is the Graylog server, web server and will also have a Mongo database. The other system will be an Elasticsearch node which is what will have the actual data stored in and indexed. For bigger “production” ready setups you just scale this out to separate systems.\nDocumentation is key here and Graylog has done an excellent job of it so here it is in case you need it: https://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/index.html I’m already assuming that you have CentOS 7 minimal installed if not you can pick up the latest CentOS at http://www.centos.org/ .The Centos systems also need a connection to the internet, and have just the root account. I'm using two systems for this tutorial so keep that in mind, here are the names of each system and what their role is:\nSERVER NAME SERVER ROLE Graylog1 (192.168.148.130) Graylog/Web/Mongo Server Graylog2 (192.168.148.132) Elasticsearch Node First let's login as the root account and update both systems and accept any updates before we do anything else.\n1yum update Install my favorite text editor for Linux called nano, don't judge me! We also wget on both systems.\n1yum install nano wget Also we need Java on both systems so let's install that.\n1yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk Let's start with server Graylog2 which will have the Elasticsearch service installed. This can be pretty big in size depending on the amount of logs you're pushing into Graylog and the retention period you have. (By default its 20 indices) Also as a note you have the the ability to cluster these Elasticseach nodes which can add additional space and redundancy to Graylog. In this tutorial we are just doing one server and currently (as of this post) Graylog does not support Elasticsearch 2.X so we to need install Elasticsearch 1.7.x. I downloaded the RPM package to root’s home directory on Graylog2. You can either use WinSCP or use wget to download that file. I then ran the following to install Elasticsearch 1.7.x. Remember install the latest 1.7.x version. Reference:https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases\n1rpm -Uvh elasticsearch-1.7.4.noarch.rpm (Side Conversation): By default the Elasicsearch stores its information in the var/lib/elasticsearch folder. Depending on the size of the Centos server you may want to change the default location, especially if you had Centos auto partition your drive. Usually the /home folder has the most space available and this varies on installations so on your own you can check by running df -h to view partitions. To change the save location for Elasicsearch edit the elasticsearch.yml located at /etc/elasticsearch/. You want to look for path.data and uncommnet it out and put down where you want Elasicsearch to store indexes. (Its easier to do this now then to wait until your partition is full\nStart elastic on bootup:\n1sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service Start the Elasticsearch service:\n1sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service Verify Elasticsearch service is started:\n1[root@GRAYLOG2 ~]# systemctl status elasticsearch.service 2â elasticsearch.service - Elasticsearch 3 Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) 4 Active: active (running) since Mon 2015-12-21 21:00:42 MST; 52s ago 5 Docs: http://www.elastic.co 6 Main PID: 2835 (java) 7 CGroup: /system.slice/elasticsearch.service 8 ââ2835 /bin/java -Xms256m -Xmx1g -Djava.awt.headless=true -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75 -XX:+UseCMSInitiating... 9 10Dec 21 21:00:42 GRAYLOG2 systemd[1]: Started Elasticsearch. 11Dec 21 21:00:42 GRAYLOG2 systemd[1]: Starting Elasticsearch...

Edit the local server's host file and put in the hostname of the server and the IP address of it to fix this error. Go to /etc/hosts using nano: (In this example the 192.168.148.130 is the Graylog1 server's IP address and the hostname of this Graylog server is GRAYLOG1)\n1127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4 2::1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6 3192.168.148.130 GRAYLOG1 After you edit that hosts file just refresh your browser session.

If you want this thing in production please look at the documentation that Graylog offers as there are things that I did not even mention, this was bare bones installation, and Graylog has a lot to offer! I hope this information was helpful, now let's kick-off 2016 as always I hope this information is helpful!\nLinks: https://www.graylog.org/ http://docs.graylog.org/en/1.3/\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2016/01/01/installing-graylog-on-centos-7/","section":"post","tags":["CentOS","graylog","logging","Software","tutorials"],"title":"Installing Graylog on Centos 7"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/logging/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"logging"},{"body":"Cisco released VIRL almost a year ago and it’s not at the 1.0 version yet but it’s getting close as they have done some good work towards the product since it first lunched. Cisco VIRL is like GNS3 which is simulation platform that runs Cisco’s current operating systems so instead of buying used Cisco hardware you can run this program on your computer. This software is geared towards proof-of-concept designs, for personal and training on Cisco Certifications. Let’s talk about it!\nHere are the links: http://virl.cisco.com/ - Main Website http://community.dev-innovate.com/c/virl - Community Form http://virl-dev-innovate.cisco.com/ - Documentation\nSo in my opinion Cisco has done a good job if you decided purchase this product at documentation, product upgrades, and new features. You need to look at the requirements before you buy as this is not your grandma’s packet tracer program. This can be a little overwhelming when you first get it but you’ll get used it when you use it more and as a bonus you get familiar with Ubuntu and Linux commands if you don’t have that under your hat already. :)\nHow Does it work? The VIRL system can run on a hypervisor like VMware Workstation/Fusion/Player or bare-metal if you have it available. You would download a OVA template if you are using VMware product line, if you go bare-metal you’ll use an ISO format. The system is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as of right now and uses some open source products like KVM/QEMU which is another hypervisor under Ubuntu. This hypervisor is able run IOS XRv, NX-OSv, CSR100v, IOSv, ASAv and even 3rd party VMs like Windows, Ubuntu, Tinycore!\nVIRL is also using Openstack and AutoNetKit. Openstack helps to create, link and delete compute and network resources with APIs and AutoNetKit is used to help build initial configurations on devices so you don’t have to do it manually. In the end there is some very cool open source projects in this VIRL system and it’s kind of weird because I’m actually getting more familiar with these open source projects because of this VIRL software and might have to look at them separately.\nThis product is a subscription based product and cost $200 a year and can handle 20 Cisco nodes at once. (Used to be 15 nodes but they bumped that up to 20) Cisco also offers some other pricing models if you want 30 nodes or if you affiliated with an academic institution. You can find all that out on the main VIRL page. So in my experience with this product so far I have found it very easy to use once you get everything worked out. It really is amazing to continue where I left off on network topology or if I’m just playing around with OSPF on a Friday night, who doesn’t right? :)\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2015/11/18/cisco-virl-update/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","Network","Software","technology","VIRL"],"title":"Cisco VIRL – Update"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco-ios/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cisco IOS"},{"body":"We have to start somewhere so let’s look at the basics of configuring OSPF. Remember OSPF is an IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) and allows packet authentication as well as IP multicast when sending and receiving updates. In this post we are configuring OSPF in a single area. In this topology we have four routers and two PCs. The PCs subnet are 172.30.2.0/24 and 172.30.3.0/24. We have point to point connections between each router.\nSo we have already configured all of interfaces and everything seems good but PC1 can’t ping PC2 and vice versa. If we do a show ip route on R1 we can see that R1 does not know about the 172.30.2.x or 172.30.3.x network as well as any other network not directly connected to R1.\n1R1#show ip route 2Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP 3 D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 4 N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 5 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 6 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 7 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route 8 o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP 9 a - application route 10 + - replicated route, % - next hop override 11 12Gateway of last resort is not set 13 14 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 6 subnets, 2 masks 15C 172.16.0.8/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 16L 172.16.0.9/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 17C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 18L 172.16.0.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 19C 172.16.128.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 20L 172.16.128.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 21 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets 22C 192.168.0.1 is directly connected, Loopback0 We also see the same issue with R3 if a routing protocol is not configured on router it will only know about its own active networks.\n1R3#show ip route 2Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP 3 D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 4 N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 5 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 6 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 7 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route 8 o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP 9 a - application route 10 + - replicated route, % - next hop override 11 12Gateway of last resort is not set 13 14 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 6 subnets, 2 masks 15C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 16L 172.16.0.14/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 17C 172.16.128.4/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 18L 172.16.128.6/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 19C 172.16.128.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 20L 172.16.128.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 21 172.30.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks 22C 172.30.3.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 23L 172.30.3.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 24 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets 25C 192.168.0.3 is directly connected, Loopback0 To configure OSPF you can do this in two ways. Let’s look at the traditional way to configure OSPF by jumping into to R1 and in the configuration mode let’s enter router ospf 1 followed by enter.\n(NOTE: 1 is the process ID for OSPF you if you don’t what to use 1 we can pick between 1-65535, also this does not have match on each router).\nWe are now under a config-router prompt, the next thing we want to do is to tell the router what IP interface you want OSPF to run on. Looking at the network topology R1 has three interfaces let’s first choose the interface that uses the IP address 172.16.0.9 and put it in area 0. (Remember wildcard subnet masks)\n1R1(config)#router ospf 1 2R1(config-router)#network 172.16.0.9 0.0.0.0 area 0 Side Conversation Area 0 is used for single-area configuration, you don’t have to use area 0 but it is recommended because Area 0 is special and not like the rest. If you ever needed two OSPF areas and they need to share routes together it won’t work without area 0 in the environment. Re-configuring a routing protocol on production may not be a good idea :). Another question that comes up when using the network command is why did I match the specific interface of 172.16.0.9? (network 172.16.0.9 0.0.0.0 ) Remember when we configure OSPF using the network command we are specifically looking at the individual interface of which we want OSPF sending and receiving updates. This is where it gets confusing because this command is not telling the router what to advertise it is simply telling the router which interfaces that you want OSPF running on. You could use the “lazy method” and allow all and future interfaces that the router has to use OSPF by using the command: (network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255). However this is a catch-22 because you are no longer in control of what interfaces that OSPF is running along with what networks are being added to OSPF. Future interfaces you configure on the router will be added to OSPF automatically and you may not want that. Personally and its a best practice to match the specific interfaces instead of using the lazy method.\nSo what just happened? Well nothing yet because R1 is this only router sending OSPF updates so let’s jump to R2 and run the following under the config-router prompt.\n1R2(config)#router ospf 1 2R2(config-router)#network 172.16.0.10 0.0.0.0 area 0 3R2(config-router)# 4*Aug 13 01:49:33.888: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.0.1 on GigabitEthernet0/1 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done Notice the OSPF Adjacency that came up, this is good news because we now have OSPF running between R1 and R2 and they are exchanging updates between each other.

This newer method is configured by going under the interface of which you want OSPF to run. Let’s configure it on R3 and R4. We still have to switch on OSPF by running the router ospf 1 command but then we can go to the interfaces.\n1R4(config)#router ospf 1 2R3(config)#router ospf 1 Now let’s go to gigabitethernet0/1 on R4 and tell OSPF this is the interface we want OSPF running on.

Going straight to R2 instead of going through R1 or R4. However OSPF knows about the other two routes which is why it is able to converge quickly. That's an important tip when comparing distance vector protocols vs link state protocols. In link state protocols routers know about the entire topology within an area and each router determines the shortest path to available destinations. So in case of a failure of the link the router would already know what path to take so there is no need to re-converge the routing table. Take a look at the routing table of R3 again after I disabled interface Gig0/3 on R2.\n1R3#show ip route 2Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP 3 D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 4 N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2 5 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2 6 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2 7 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route 8 o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP 9 a - application route 10 + - replicated route, % - next hop override 11 12Gateway of last resort is not set 13 14 172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 2 masks 15O 172.16.0.8/30 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 01:04:20, GigabitEthernet0/2 16C 172.16.0.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 17L 172.16.0.14/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2 18O 172.16.128.0/30 19 [110/2] via 172.16.128.14, 01:04:40, GigabitEthernet0/1 20 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 01:04:20, GigabitEthernet0/2 21C 172.16.128.4/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 22L 172.16.128.6/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/3 23O 172.16.128.8/30 24 [110/2] via 172.16.128.14, 01:04:40, GigabitEthernet0/1 25C 172.16.128.12/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 26L 172.16.128.13/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1 27 172.30.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 3 subnets, 2 masks 28O 172.30.2.0/24 [110/3] via 172.16.128.14, 00:31:22, GigabitEthernet0/1 29 [110/3] via 172.16.0.13, 00:31:22, GigabitEthernet0/2 30C 172.30.3.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 31L 172.30.3.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/4 32 192.168.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets 33O 192.168.0.1 [110/2] via 172.16.0.13, 01:04:20, GigabitEthernet0/2 34C 192.168.0.3 is directly connected, Loopback0 35R3# We can now see two routes to the 172.30.2.0 network.

Thanks Paessler which has kept it simple with their PRTG monitoring system as the hardest part of this script was getting the data in HTML, remember I don't write much powershell. ;) If you have not used PRTG before check it out if you need some alerting in your environment. Personally this is one of my favorite systems for just monitoring because a lot of other monitoring systems include everything but the kitchen sink and reality we just need to know what's up and what's down. This script grabs an XML file that PRTG builds and saves it as \u0026quot;table.xml\u0026quot; I have the script check if there are any sensors in trouble if not send an email. If PRTG is reporting a sensor or sensors that are in trouble this scripts builds an HTML document with a table and list the sensors in trouble highlighting the status column with the appropriate color and sends an email.\nThanks goes to Martin Pugh who has provided the set-cellcolor function. :)\n1# PRTG EMAIL ACTIVE ALARMS POWERSHELL SCRIPT. 2# USE TASK SCHEDULER TO RUN THIS SCRIPT. 3# Load up the function \u0026#34;Set-CellColor\u0026#34; thanks to Martin Pugh \u0026lt;img draggable=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34; role=\u0026#34;img\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;emoji\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;🙂\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/svg/1f642.svg\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 4Function Set-CellColor 5{ \u0026lt;# 6 .SYNOPSIS 7 Function that allows you to set individual cell colors in an HTML table 8 .DESCRIPTION 9 To be used inconjunction with ConvertTo-HTML this simple function allows you 10 to set particular colors for cells in an HTML table.

I took the test last week and passed, however there were some questions on the exam I noticed that weren't on the exam blueprint so that kind of surprised me. I was happy to still be able to pass the exam but I was caught off guard. So with that I’ll let you know what I used to study and what areas I think might help so you won't be as \u0026quot;surprised\u0026quot; as I was.\nOverall the exam did a good job of testing on the NX-OS software and the overall basic networking fundamentals (ICND1 material with touch of Nexus) which is what this test is supposed to be about. However there are questions that surprised me and was not ready because of the lack of information about the test. When I started studying for this exam I read the exam blueprint for the 640-911 to get an idea of what to expect but I feel that some things are missing from that blueprint. What also is interesting is of all the material I read and watched there was no mention of it. So here are some areas that I think you should look at before you take the exam:\nKnow the models of all the Nexus switches like the 2000, 3000, 5000, 6000, 7000, and 9000 portfolios. Know the basics of what each offers and their limitations. It’s also helpful to know what the popular type of connections to use between servers and these switches. (Read the data sheets) Link: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/data-center-switches/index.html#~products-services\nLook at buying the CCNA Data Center 640-916 Official Cert Guide, or the Cert Library which includes the 640-911 and 640-916 books because in chapter two of the 640-916 book it talks about the hardware of Nexus switches which is very valuable considering some this is on the 640-911 exam. I noticed this after the fact! The material I have read/watched: CCNA Data DCICT 640-911 Offical Cert Guide - Odom CBT Nuggets - Anthony Sequeira CCNA Data Center - Introducing Cisco Data Center Networking Study Guide - Todd Lammle Cisco Learning Network (CCNA Data Center)\nI hope this information is helpful and good luck on this exam you’ve been warned :P\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2015/05/14/passed-the-640-911-dcicn/","section":"post","tags":["640-911","CCNA Data Center","Cisco","Data center","networking","Nexus","NX-OS","technology"],"title":"Passed the 640-911 DCICN"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco-career-certifications/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cisco Career Certifications"},{"body":"The purpose of this post is to reference the CCNA Data Center (640-911) exam. This exam starts the conversation of IPv6 and since IPv6 is hexadecimal this post starts the talk about how we look at a hexadecimal values and learn how to convert them to binary and decimal. If you know subnetting skills then this won’t be that difficult. If you are new then check out The Wonders of Binary post as well as Part 1 and Part 2 of subnetting. Let’s get started!\nJumping right into it if we look at this hexadecimal value 0x56A we know it’s hexadecimal because the “0x” is the prefix for a hexadecimal number so we really don’t need to do anything with the “0x”. Let’s focus on the 56A value. So where do we start? Remember that 0-9 are normal decimal values so \u0026quot;5\u0026quot; actually means \u0026quot;5\u0026quot;. We want to convert these values into binary. Followed by converting them into a decimal value. So what does the value 5 look like in binary? We then move to the next digit \u0026quot;6\u0026quot; what does that look like in binary? Then the last value is \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, what does that look like in binary? Hint: A-F would be 10-15 in decimal. Reference chart below.\nHEXADECIMAL DECIMAL BINARY 0 0 0000 1 1 0001 2 2 0010 3 3 0011 4 4 0100 5 5 0101 6 6 0110 7 7 0111 8 8 1000 9 9 1001 A 10 1010 B 11 1011 C 12 1100 D 13 1101 E 14 1110 F 15 1111 Looking at the value 56A we would want to combine all the single values into one binary string. (Example 5 in binary is: 0101, 6 in binary is: 0110, A in binary is: 1010) Combine these together and the the answer would be: 01010110101 (You can drop leading zeros) 1010110101 What does that value look like in decimal? Write it out and remember the power of 2s and always start with \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;. The answer comes out as: 1,386. Of course you can reverse engineer this if you were given a decimal value and needed to convert it into hexadecimal.\nFor example convert the following decimal 187 into hexadecimal. Write out 187 into binary so that answer looks like: 10111011. You also want to split the binary string into equal parts, so the answer would be: 1011:1011 comparing the chart or doing this yourself convert this binary into hexadecimal. Since binary strings are the same our hexadecimal is: BB. That's it! Understanding how to convert hex to decimal and back starts to get important when IPv6 shows up at the door. Although this is a fundamental level topic that's exactly why its important to understand it. Just like subnetting, I would use a calculator if you ever find yourself converting these values. It's always a good idea to double-check your work. However on the exam you don't have that pleasure so learning it the manual way is this only way. :)\nStatic Comments: larry hynds - Apr 2, 2015\nthis is fantastic information and i truly thank you for this. i am planning to take my eame this summer. if you have any more suggestion dor the exm i would apprechiate it. regards, storm\n#### [Ryan](http://ciscoskills.net/ \"ryan@ciscoskills.net\") - Apr 2, 2015\rI'm glad this is going to help, Good Luck on the exam :)\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2015/04/22/converting-hexadecimal-to-decimal-and-binary/","section":"post","tags":["640-911","CCNA Data Center","Cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","ipv6","Network","networking","technology","tutorial"],"title":"Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal and Binary"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ipv6/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ipv6"},{"body":"In my last post I talked about Installing Rancid on Centos 7 so be sure to check that out. In this post we now want to actually use Rancid so I’ll walk through on how to setup Rancid to login into network equipment and get configurations.\nTo recap: Rancid is a great tool to help monitor a device configuration for any changes. It also keeps track of them by using CVS (Concurrent Version System) for backups, so you can go back and compare versions or revert to a previous configuration. Rancid supports multiple hardware from Cisco, HP, Dell, Juniper and more. This is all open-source so you can create custom scripts or add commands to really make this a personal repository that fits your company.\nRancid has a couple of areas that need to be edited before we can let it run. The first area is the router.db file. This file is in each “group” or folder that rancid stores. In our example we have two groups’ routers and switches. This file has all the devices you want rancid to keep track of. We must edit this file with either the DNS name of the device or IP address. To do that go to the following:\nLogin into Rancid with the Root account followed by su – rancid Type of Device is the “group” you configured the List of Groups under the rancid.conf file during the installation\n1nano /usr/local/rancid/var/{Type of Device}/router.db At first this is a blank file so nothing will be in the file, below is an example of what I have done in the past\n1# This is an example of a router.db fle in Rancid. 2 3# Location of File /usr/local/rancid/var/Routers/router.db 4 5# Type the Router name or IP followed by the type of device. (Rancid supports more than just Cisco) 6 7# Personally I think it looks better with DNS names. 8 9Router01.example.com;cisco;up; 10 11# You can also mark a device as down. This will cause Rancid to skip it. 12 13Router02.example.com;cisco;down; 14 15Router03.example.com;cisco;up; 16 17# Of course you can also comments throughout this file or alongside devices for notes. 18 19# Edge Switches for Computers at HQ 20 21Switch-HQ-Edge14.example.com;cisco;up; LOCATION: Server Rack A 22 23Switch-HQ-Edge07.example.com;cisco;up; LOCATION: Room 101 24 25Switch-HQ-Edge21.example.com;cisco;down; LOCATION: Building A (Under Construction) Once you add the all the devices in each Router.db we now need to look at the .clogin file which is located (/home/rancid/.cloginrc) this file will store the usernames and passwords for each device, this file supports wildcards so if you have a good naming scheme use it! I have had luck with commenting out everything in that file and just starting at the bottom of the file with my custom configuration, such as:\n1# Custom Configuration at the bottom of .cloginrc 2 3# No Enable Prompts 4 5add noenable Swich-E-Edge05.example.com 1 6 7# Connect to All CORES (Notice the wildcard, remember you still need to add the full name to the router.db file.) 8 9add user S-core0*.example.com username-goes-here 10 11add password S-core0*.example.com password-goes-here 12 13add method S-core0*.example.com ssh 14 15add noenable S-core0*.example.com 1 16 17# Connect To All Campus-5-Edge Switches 18 19add user Switch-C5-Edge*.example.com username-goes-here 20 21add password Switch-C5-Edge*.example.com password-goes-here enable-password-here 22 23add method Switch-C5-Edge*.example.com ssh So we now have everything ready to test run rancid, we can test our luck by just running it once and to do that run the following command below. When the commands completes you should be able to browse via the webpage, see the devices you added with their configurations, and get an email if you’ve followed by earlier post.\n1/usr/local/rancid/bin/rancid-run For reference rancid keeps a log each time it runs and each different of group or device. To view the log use my favorite Linux test editor nano. :) Or you can cat it!\n1nano /usr/local/rancid/var/logs/{Type of Device/Group} In this example log file everything went well, rancid is pretty good at telling you what the issue is if there is one.\n1starting: Sun Feb 15 18:01:56 MST 2015 2 3Trying to get all of the configs. 4 5All routers sucessfully completed. 6 7cvs diff: Diffing . 8 9cvs diff: Diffing configs 10 11cvs commit: Examining . 12 13cvs commit: Examining configs 14 15ending: Sun Feb 15 18:02:45 MST 2015 Once you capture devices you can view their configuration on the browser by going to http(s)://rancid-server-ip/viewvc. In this example I just have one device with two revisions on it, I'm using router03.example.com. What do you think?\nScreenshot of Rancid in ViewVC, using Router03 as an example. Diff between revisions on Router03. One of the last things to do is to setup a cron job to run rancid, it depends on your environment but in this example I'm running the rancid job every hour on the hour. I'm also clearing the log files every five days but running the job every day day at 11:50pm. Below is my example of the cron job. Make sure you in the rancid account (su - rancid) and then type crontab -e. Note you will be using vi so here is a crash course once you in the file type \u0026quot;i\u0026quot; for INSERT MODE type out the configuration once you are done type Escape key followed by \u0026quot;:wq\u0026quot; which will write (save) and quit the vi program.\n1# 2# Rancid User Crontab File 3# 4 5# Begin Hourly Router Dump 61 * * * * /usr/local/rancid/bin/rancid-run 7 8# Begin Cleanup of Differ Logs Every 5 Days 950 23 * * * /usr/bin/find /usr/local/rancid/var/logs -type f -mtime +5 -exec rm -rf {} \\; We now have a system that will log in and grab configurations of our network equipment on a scheduled basis. Rancid does way more than just Cisco devices although its in the name :). Rancid has made it pretty easy to even add you own custom scripts or add-on to what you want to see when rancid pulls a configuration so like before check out Shrubbery at http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/ and the threads from Rancid Discussions at http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/rancid/ for details. I'll stop it here I hope this information is helpful and as always let me know if you have any questions.\nStatic Comments: sunny - Aug 6, 2015\ngreat write-up, thanks. Do you have an article listing the steps to setup 'cisco-sb' type devices to be congured with Rancid-3.1 or 3.2. I did every possible config/changes but could not get it to work. Finally had to downgrade rancid to 2.3.8 and then i was able for rancid to pull the config of cisco-sb devices. thanks sunny\nElliot - Feb 2, 2016\nHello. Thank you for this guide, it is really helpful. I followed your two guides but I have a problem when I run RANCID. When I run /usr/local/rancid/bin/rancid-run, it takes a few seconds, I have only one switch at the moment so I think it's working. But when I go to viewvc, I just have rev. 1.1, with nothing in, and I don't have a new one (like 1.2 ...) when I run it again. In my file router.db I just have this : { my IP xx.xx.xx.xx };cisco;up In my file .cloginrc I just added : add user xx.xx.xx.xx Test (it works when i connect with this user by ssh) ad password xx.xx.xx.xx password password (the password works for connection and enable) ad method xx.xx.xx.xx ssh Are my files ok? I'm sorry, I don't speak english very well, I hope you will understand ! Thank you. Elliot\nElliot - Feb 5, 2016\nHello. Yes I put HP instead of cisco but it doesn't work ^^ I think this type of HP switch isn't supported by RANCID ! I'm not an expert too, so I will try to use anything else ^^ Thank you again for your answers and your tutorial ! Elliot\nblakestock - Sep 3, 2015\nThanks for the guide! I’ve got RANCID up and running but it doesn’t seem to actually be polling the devices and getting their configs. When I run /usr/local/rancid/bin/rancid-run it takes about 1 second to finish but I’ve got 9 different devices it should be logging into. When I check the ViewVC page the devices are not showing up individually but it does show the router.db file The logs for running RANCID manually just show: starting: Wed Sep 23 16:40:15 EDT 2015 ending: Wed Sep 23 16:40:15 EDT 2015 I can ssh to each device with the username I’ve made for RANCID from the server fine. Any ideas on what I’m missing? Thanks! Blake\nRyan - Sep 3, 2015\nHey Blake, Did you follow another post I did about Installing Rancid? https://ciscoskills.net/2015/01/03/install-rancid-and-viewvc-on-centos-7/ Go over that and see if you are missing anything, you should see some cvs information and any errors/successes about devices in your router.db file. If you seeing blank logs it is likely rancid is not understanding the router.db file.\n1# This is an example of a router.db fle in Rancid. 2 3#Location of File /usr/local/rancid/var/Routers/router.db 4 5#Type the Router name or IP followed by the type of device.

I had an older version of RANCID running and in that the router.db file used colons instead of semi-colons. I had copied the old router.db file to the new server running current version and that's why it didn't read the routers or log into any of them. Thanks for your help and this great guide!!\nRyan - Feb 2, 2016\nHey Elliot, Check the logs by going to nano /usr/local/rancid/var/logs/ and scroll through it and see what it says. You can also test logins by using clogin since you are using Cisco equipment. On CLI login into rancid, su - rancid then run this command to connect to one of your devices /usr/local/rancid/bin/clogin (IP address/Name of device) hit enter. If it all works you should be connected to your equipment, if not it should give you an error and from there you could troubleshoot more. Hope that Helps. Ryan\nElliot - Feb 3, 2016\nHi, thank you for the answer /usr/local/rancid/var/logs/ is empty .... I think it's a problem :) When i use /usr/local/rancid/bin/clogin, I don't have enough time to enter my password, and even if I'm fast enough and I enter the right password, I have an erroer : Authentication failed. I have probably made something wrong ! It's maybe a problem with the switch? Thank you Elliot\nElliot - Feb 3, 2016\nI checked my log file, obviously it's a password problem. I don't know why but it looks like it doesn't use the password that I give.... Because when I use /usr/local/rancid/bin/clogin I'm connected but when i use ssh I have this error : spawn ssh -c 3des -x -l rancid xx.xx.xx.xx Password: Password: Password: rancid@10.1.249.123's password: Connection closed by xx.xx.xx.xx When I use telnet : spawn telnet xx.xx.xx.xx Trying xx.xx.xx.xx... Connected to xx.xx.xx.xx. Escape character is '^]'. User Access Verification Password: % Authentication failed Password: Error: Check your passwd for xx.xx.xx.xx But i give the right password ... When I use the command : /usr/local/rancid/bin/clogin -u rancid -p password ( the same) xx.xx.xx.xx It works ! I'm connected to my switch, I have just an error for enable but it's because I don't give him the password. Thank you\nRyan - Feb 3, 2016\nHey Elliot, Check your /home/rancid/.cloginrc file. If clogin is not working than there is something wrong with your .cloginrc file. Comment out everything in that file and just start at the bottom of the file with you own configuration. Hope that Helps. Ryan\nElliot - Feb 4, 2016\nI commented evrything except what I added... And now it works ! I looked for it one entire day, just for a problem of comment ^^ Thank you from France. :) Elliot\nElliot - Feb 4, 2016\nHello it's me again! Now, it's working with a cisco switch, but not with HP switch :) I can connect to the switch without problem, but with hp switch the command to have access to the configuration is not \u0026quot;enable\u0026quot; but \u0026quot;_cmdline-mode\u0026quot; So when i use \u0026quot;/usr/local/rancid/bin/clogin I have this : Username:xxx Password: enable ^ % Unrecognized command found at '^' position. So i would like to modify something to make rancid uses \u0026quot;_cmdline-mode\u0026quot; and not enable, but I don't know how to do this :s I tried to use \u0026quot;add enableprompt\u0026quot; but I don't know if it's what this command do Thanks a lot. Elliot\nElliot - Feb 4, 2016\nSorry for triple post but I can't edit my post ... In /usr/local/rancid/var/logs/ i have this : starting: jeu. fÃ©vr. 11 11:10:58 CET 2016 hourly config diffs failed: /tmp/.Switchs.run.lock exists -rw-r-----. 1 rancid netadm 0 11 fÃ©vr. 10:26 /tmp/.Switchs.run.lock ending: jeu. fÃ©vr. 11 11:10:58 CET 2016 For my hp switch I have this in /.cloginrc: add user 10.1.249.59 {admin} add autoenable 10.1.249.59 1 add password 10.1.249.59 {admin} {password} add method 10.1.249.59 {telnet} I said in my last post that I need to use the command \u0026quot;_cmdline-mode\u0026quot; but I'm not sure that I have to use it to have access to the configuration of the switch. gG Anyway, Rancid doesn't work with my HP switch ! It's an HP 1920-8G Thank you\nRyan - Feb 4, 2016\nHey Elliot, I know Rancid does support some HP hardware but I'm not entirely sure if your HP hardware is supported. In the router.db you put HP as the device instead of Cisco right? If that doesn't work its probably something you would have to modify in rancid and that is something I'm not an expert in. You could check out http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/rancid/announce/ and post/search for your question over there.

To finish this installation off we need to setup Rancid to send emails. Usually you have to add the Rancid to the allowed senders list on your email infrastructure. Rancid uses aliases to send emails we need to edit the aliases file.\n1nano /etc/aliases Depending on your infrastructure you might have different teams of people for different equipment that rancid is monitoring. Or you are running one-man-shop either way you can specify. In this example I'm using only one email address and created a new aliases called Rancid all of this is at the bottom of the aliases file.\n1# Custom Rancid Configuration (Put an Email Here) 2rancid: emailaddress@goeshere.com 3 4# Custom Rancid Configuration 5rancid-admin-Routers: rancid 6rancid-Routers: rancid 7rancid-admin-Switches: rancid 8rancid-Switches: rancid Depending on what you created in your List of Groups in the rancid configuration file you might have more or less. (In this example we just created Routers and Switches) We must specify these in the aliases file otherwise Rancid wont send emails for these groups. Once we are done editing you want to let our Rancid box know about the new aliases we just created. Type in the following command to update.\n1newaliases In this example postfix is already installed so we just need to edit the postfix configuration file.\n1nano /etc/postfix/main.cf Find and uncomment \u0026quot;relayhost\u0026quot; and type either the domain name (if you have MX records) the FQDN or IP address of your email system.\n1relayhost = mycompanydomain.com 2relayhost = email.mycompanydomain.com 3#relayhost = [mailserver.isp.tld] 4#relayhost = uucphost 5#relayhost = [an.ip.add.ress] Start up posfix and enable it on boot\n1systemctl start postfix 2systemctl enable postfix Finished! We have just installed Rancid along with made some helpful tweaks like getting an upfront web page to view the configurations instead of CLI as well as setting up Rancid to email us if anything changes or if there are issues with connecting to any equipment. I'll put the brakes here and in the next post we will go over how to customize rancid to log into devices and grab configurations. I hope this install guide is helpful and let me know if you have any questions. Enjoy New Year! :) If you can't wait for me then you can check Shrubbery at http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/ Read the README file once you download Rancid.

You have no hangs like mentioned in http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/EXPECTBUG ?\nBen - May 3, 2015\nFirst off thanks so much for the detail you put into these instructions. I am hoping though, you might be able to help with an error I'm getting. I went through your list without incident until the first reboot and attempting to browse to rancid-ip/viewvc which returns a traceback error.\n1Python Traceback 2 3Traceback (most recent call last): 4File \u0026#34;/usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/lib/viewvc.py\u0026#34;, line 4848, in main 5request.run_viewvc() 6File \u0026#34;/usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/lib/viewvc.py\u0026#34;, line 402, in run_viewvc 7self.view_func(self) 8File \u0026#34;/usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/lib/viewvc.py\u0026#34;, line 2202, in view_roots 9allroots = list_roots(request) 10File \u0026#34;/usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/lib/viewvc.py\u0026#34;, line 4698, in list_roots 11cfg.utilities, cfg.options.use_rcsparse) 12File \u0026#34;/usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/lib/vclib/ccvs/init.py\u0026#34;, line 56, in CVSRepository 13rootpath = canonicalize_rootpath(rootpath) 14File \u0026#34;/usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/lib/vclib/ccvs/init.py\u0026#34;, line 17, in canonicalize_rootpath 15assert os.path.isabs(rootpath) 16AssertionError I've tried googling and found only one forum poster with an identical error.. he says that he resolved his by modifying 'rcs_dir = /usr/local/bin' to 'rcs_dir = /usr/bin' Which I did after LS'ing and finding out that /usr/local/bin was empty. However after another reboot the error persists. Any ideas would be awesome.. this is my second attempt at a successful config and I'm getting frustrated. Thanks!\nBen - May 4, 2015\nThanks Ryan.. Actually what I wound up doing was deleting the vhd and starting over from scratch with your page. I actually have it all working save one thing.. Rancid actually creating the config files. My boss is pushing DR and I won;t have a whole lot of time left in the near future to work on this so thats why I decided to start all over. But yeah I can run clogin x.x.x.x and end up with a responsive ssh prompt to that switch. But rancid-run generates nothing at all, even an empty log file.\nmlf - May 2, 2015\nIt just worked with RHEL 6.5. After many attempts with other guides this one was just amazing.

Within 39 40each section, are a number of configuration settings. These settings 41 42take the form of: name = value. Values may be continued on the 43 44following line by indenting the continued line. 45 46## 47 48WARNING: Indentation always means continuation. Name=value lines 49 50should always start in column zero. 51 52## 53 54Comments should always start in column zero, and are identified 55 56with “#”. By default each of the configuration items is 57 58commented out, with the default value of the option shown. 59 60You’ll need to remove the ‘#’ that precedes configuration 61 62options whose values you wish to modify. 63 64## 65 66Certain configuration settings may have multiple values. These should 67 68be separated by a comma. The settings where this is allowed are noted 69 70below. Any other setting that requires special syntax is noted at that 71 72setting. 73 74## 75 76SOME TERMINOLOGY USED HEREIN 77 78## 79 80“root” – This is a CVS or Subversion repository. For Subversion, the 81 82meaning is pretty clear, as the virtual, versioned directory tree 83 84stored inside a Subversion repository looks nothing like the actual 85 86tree visible with shell utilities that holds the repository. For 87 88CVS, this is more confusing, because CVS’s repository layout mimics 89 90(actually, defines) the layout of the stuff housed in the repository. 91 92But a CVS repository can be identified by the presence of a CVSROOT 93 94subdirectory in its root directory. 95 96## 97 98“module” – A module is a top-level subdirectory of a root, usually 99 100associated with the concept of a single “project” among many housed 101 102within a single repository. 103 104## 105## 106 107BASIC VIEWVC CONFIGURATION HINTS 108 109## 110 111While ViewVC has quite a few configuration options, you generally 112 113only need to change a small subset of them to get your ViewVC 114 115installation working properly. Here are some options that we 116 117recommend you pay attention to. Of course, don’t try to change the 118 119options here — do so in the relevant section of the configuration 120 121file below. 122 123For correct operation, you will probably need to change the following 124 125configuration variables: 126 127cvs_roots (for CVS) 128 129svn_roots (for Subversion) 130 131root_parents (for CVS or Subversion) 132 133default_root 134 135root_as_url_component 136 137rcs_dir 138 139mime_types_files 140 141the many options in the [utilities] section 142 143It is usually desirable to change the following variables: 144 145address 146 147forbidden 148 149To optimize delivery of ViewVC static files: 150 151docroot 152 153To customize the display of ViewVC for your site: 154 155template_dir 156 157the [templates] override section 158 159## 160 161##————————————————————————— 162[general] 163 164cvs_roots: Specifies each of the CVS roots on your system and 165 166assigns names to them. Each root should be given by a “name: path” 167 168value (where the path is an absolute filesystem path). Multiple roots 169 170should be separated by commas and can be placed on separate lines. 171 172## 173 174Example: 175 176cvs_roots = cvsroot: /opt/cvs/repos1, 177 178anotherroot: /usr/local/cvs/repos2 179 180## 181#cvs_roots = cvs: 182 183svn_roots: Specifies each of the Subversion roots (repositories) on 184 185your system and assigns names to them. Each root should be given by 186 187a “name: path” value (where the path is an absolute filesystem path). 188 189Multiple roots should be separated by commas and can be placed on 190 191separate lines. 192 193## 194 195NOTE: ViewVC offers experimental support for displaying remote 196 197Subversion repositories. Simply use the repository’s URL instead 198 199of a local filesystem path when defining the root. 200 201## 202 203Example: 204 205svn_roots = svnrepos: /opt/svn/, 206 207anotherrepos: /usr/local/svn/repos2 208 209## 210#svn_roots = 211 212root_parents: Specifies a list of directories under which any 213 214number of repositories may reside. You can specify multiple root 215 216parents separated by commas or new lines, each of which is of the 217 218form “path: type” (where the type is either “cvs” or “svn”, and 219 220the path is an absolute filesystem path). 221 222## 223 224Rather than force you to add a new entry to ‘cvs_roots’ or 225 226‘svn_roots’ each time you create a new repository, ViewVC rewards 227 228you for organizing all your repositories under a few parent 229 230directories by allowing you to simply tell it about those parent 231 232directories. ViewVC will then notice each repository of the 233 234specified type in that directory as a root whose name is the 235 236subdirectory in which that repository lives. 237 238## 239 240For example, if you have three Subversion repositories located at 241 242/opt/svn/projects, /opt/svn/websites, and /opt/svn/devstuff, you 243 244could list them individually in svn_roots like so: 245 246## 247 248svn_roots = projects: /opt/svn/projects, 249 250websites: /opt/svn/websites, 251 252devstuff: /opt/svn/devstuff 253 254## 255 256or you could instead use the root_parents configuration option: 257 258## 259 260root_parents = /opt/svn: svn 261 262## 263 264The benefit of this latter approach is that, as you add new 265 266repositories to your /opt/svn directory, they automatically become 267 268available for display in ViewVC without additional configuration. 269 270## 271 272WARNING: the root names derived for repositories configured via the 273 274root_parents option can, of course, clash with names you have 275 276defined in your cvs_roots or svn_roots configuration items. If 277 278this occurs, you can either rename the offending repository on 279 280disk, or grant new names to the clashing item in cvs_roots or 281 282svn_roots. Each parent path is processed sequentially, so the 283 284names of repositories under later parent paths may override earlier 285 286ones. 287 288## 289 290Example: 291 292root_parents = /opt/svn: svn, 293 294/opt/cvs: cvs 295 296## 297#root_parents = /usr/local/rancid/var/CVS : cvs 298 299default_root: This is the name of the default root. Valid names 300 301include those explicitly listed in the cvs_roots and svn_roots 302 303configuration options, as well as those implicitly indicated by 304 305virtue of being the basenames of repositories found in the 306 307root_parents option locations. 308 309## 310 311NOTE: This setting is ignored when root_as_url_component is enabled. 312 313## 314 315Example: 316 317default_root = cvsroot 318 319## 320#default_root = 321 322mime_types_files: This is a list of pathnames to a set of MIME type 323 324mapping files to help ViewVC guess the correct MIME type of a 325 326versioned file. The pathnames listed here are specified in order of 327 328authoritativeness either as absolute paths or relative to this 329 330configuration file. 331 332## 333 334As a convenience, ViewVC provides a MIME type mapping file 335 336(mimetypes.conf) which is, by default, the preferred provider of 337 338MIME type mapping answers, but which is also empty. If you find 339 340that ViewVC is unable to accurately guess MIME types based on the 341 342extensions of some of your versioned files, you can add records of 343 344your preferred mappings to the provided mimetypes.conf file (or to 345 346your system’s mapping files, if you wish). 347 348## 349 350You might, for example, wish to have ViewVC also consult the mapping 351 352files provided by your operating system and Apache. 353 354## 355 356Example: 357 358mime_types_files = mimetypes.conf, 359 360/etc/mime.types, 361 362/usr/local/apache2/conf/mime.types 363 364## 365#mime_types_files = mimetypes.conf 366 367address: The address of the local repository maintainer. (This 368 369option is provided only as a convenience for ViewVC installations 370 371which are using the default template set, where the value of this 372 373option will be displayed in the footer of every ViewVC page.) 374 375## 376 377Example: 378 379address = admin@server.com 380 381## 382#address = 383 384kv_files: Provides a mechanism for custom key/value pairs to be 385 386available to templates. These are stored in key/value (KV) files. 387 388## 389 390The paths of the KV files are listed here, specified either as 391 392absolute paths or relative to this configuration file. The files 393 394use the same format as this configuration file, containing one or 395 396more user-defined sections, and user-defined options in those 397 398sections. ViewVC makes these options available to template authors 399 400as: 401 402## 403 404kv.SECTION.OPTION 405 406## 407 408Note that an option name can be dotted. For example: 409 410## 411 412[my_images] 413 414logos.small = /images/small-logo.png 415 416logos.big = /images/big-logo.png 417 418## 419 420Templates can use these with a directive like: [kv.my_images.logos.small] 421 422## 423 424Note that section names which are common to multiple KV files will 425 426be merged. If two files have a [my_images] section, then the 427 428options in those two like-named sections will be merged together. 429 430If two files have the same option name in a section, then one will 431 432overwrite the other (and which one “wins” is unspecified). 433 434## 435 436To further categorize the KV files, and how the values are provided to 437 438the templates, a KV file name may be annotated with an additional level 439 440of dotted naming. For example: 441 442## 443 444kv_files = [asf]kv/images.conf 445 446## 447 448Assuming the same section as above, the template would refer to an image 449 450using [kv.asf.my_images.logos.small] 451 452## 453 454Lastly, it is possible to use %lang% in the filenames to specify a 455 456substitution of the selected language-tag. 457 458## 459 460Example: 461 462kv_files = kv/file1.conf, kv/file2.conf, [i18n]kv/%lang%_data.conf 463 464## 465#kv_files = 466 467This option is a comma-separated list of language-tag values 468 469available to ViewVC. The first language-tag listed is the default 470 471language, and will be used if an Accept-Language header is not 472 473present in the request, or none of the user’s requested languages 474 475are available. If there are ties on the selection of a language, 476 477then the first to appear in the list is chosen. 478 479## 480 481Example: 482 483languages = en-us, en-gb, de 484 485## 486#languages = en-us 487 488##————————————————————————— 489[utilities] 490 491ViewVC uses (sometimes optionally) various third-party programs to do some 492 493of the heavy lifting. Generally, it will attempt to execute those utility 494 495programs in such a way that if they are found in ViewVC’s executable 496 497search path ($PATH, %PATH%, etc.) all is well. But sometimes these tools 498 499aren’t installed in the executable search path, so here’s where you can 500 501tell ViewVC where to find them. 502 503## 504 505NOTE: Options with a “_dir” suffix are for configuring the 506 507directories in which certain programs live. Note that this might 508 509not be the same directory into which the program’s installer dumped 510 511the whole program package — we want the deepest directory in which 512 513the executable program itself resides (“C:\\rcstools\\bin\\win32” 514 515rather than just “C:\\rcstools”, for example). The values of options 516 517whose names lack the “_dir” suffix should point to the actual 518 519program itself (such as “C:\\Program Files\\cvsnt\\cvs.exe”). 520 521rcs_dir: Directory in which the RCS utilities are installed, used 522 523for viewing CVS repositories. 524 525## 526 527Example: 528 529rcs_dir = /usr/bin/ 530 531## 532#rcs_dir = /usr/local/bin 533 534cvsnt: Location of cvsnt program. ViewVC can use CVSNT (www.cvsnt.org) 535 536instead of the RCS utilities to retrieve information from CVS 537 538repositories. To enable use of CVSNT, set the “cvsnt” value to the 539 540path of the CVSNT executable. (If CVSNT is on the standard path, you 541 542can also set it to the name of the CVSNT executable). By default 543 544“cvsnt” is set to “cvs” on Windows and is not set on other platforms. 545 546## 547 548Examples: 549 550cvsnt = K:\\Program Files\\cvsnt\\cvs.exe 551 552cvsnt = /usr/bin/cvs 553 554cvsnt = cvs 555 556## 557#cvsnt = 558 559svn: Location of the Subversion command-line client, used for 560 561viewing Subversion repositories. 562 563## 564 565Example: 566 567svn = /usr/bin/svn 568 569## 570#svn = 571 572diff: Location of the GNU diff program, used for showing file 573 574version differences. 575 576## 577 578Example: 579 580diff = /usr/bin/diff 581 582## 583#diff = 584 585cvsgraph: Location of the CvsGraph program, a graphical CVS version 586 587graph generator (see options.use_cvsgraph). 588 589## 590 591Example: 592 593cvsgraph = /usr/local/bin/cvsgraph 594 595## 596#cvsgraph = 597 598##————————————————————————— 599[options] 600 601root_as_url_component: Interpret the first path component in the URL 602 603after the script location as the root to use. This is an 604 605alternative to using the “root=” query key. If ViewVC is configured 606 607with multiple repositories, this results in more natural looking 608 609ViewVC URLs. 610 611## 612 613NOTE: Enabling this option will break backwards compatibility with 614 615any old ViewCVS URL which doesn’t have an explicit “root” parameter. 616 617## 618#root_as_url_component = 1 619 620checkout_magic: Use checkout links with magic /checkout/ prefixes so 621 622checked out HTML pages can have working links to other repository files 623 624## 625 626NOTE: This option is DEPRECATED and should not be used in new ViewVC 627 628installations.

Thus, if you add “image/*” to this list, ‘markup’-view 735 736display of JPEG, GIF, and PNG images will be disabled. 737 738## 739 740Example: 741 742binary_mime_types = application/octet-stream, image/*, application/pdf, 743 744application/vnd*, application/msword, audio/* 745 746# 747#binary_mime_types = 748 749authorizer: The name of the ViewVC authorizer plugin to use when 750 751authorizing access to repository contents. This value must be the 752 753name of a Python module addressable as vcauth.MODULENAME (most 754 755easily accomplished by placing it in ViewVC’s lib/vcauth/ directory) 756 757and which implements a ViewVCAuthorizer class (as a subclass of 758 759vcauth.GenericViewVCAuthorizer). You can provide custom parameters 760 761to the authorizer module by defining configuration sections named 762 763authz-MODULENAME and adding the parameter keys and values there. 764 765## 766 767ViewVC provides the following modules: 768 769svnauthz – based on Subversion authz files 770 771forbidden – simple path glob matches against top-level root directories 772 773forbiddenre – root and path matches against regular expressions 774 775## 776 777NOTE: Only one authorizer may be in use for a given ViewVC request. 778 779It doesn’t matter if you configure the parameters of multiple 780 781authorizer plugins — only the authorizer whose name is configured 782 783here (or effectively configured here via per-vhost or per-root 784 785configuration) will be activated. 786 787## 788#authorizer = 789 790hide_cvsroot: Don’t show the CVSROOT directory 791 7921 Hide CVSROOT directory 793 7940 Show CVSROOT directory 795 796## 797 798NOTE: Someday this option may be removed in favor of letting 799 800individual authorizer plugin hide the CVSROOT. 801 802## 803#hide_cvsroot = 1 804 805mangle_email_addresses: Mangle email addresses in marked-up output. 806 807There are various levels of mangling available: 808 8090 – No mangling; markup un-mangled email addresses as hyperlinks 810 8111 – Obfuscation (using entity encoding); no hyperlinking 812 8132 – Data-dropping address truncation; no hyperlinking 814 815## 816 817NOTE: this will not effect the display of versioned file contents, only 818 819addresses that appear in version control metadata (e.g. log messages). 820 821## 822#mangle_email_addresses = 0 823 824custom_log_formatting: Specifies mappings of regular expressions to 825 826substitution format strings used to URL-ize strings found in 827 828revision log messages. Multiple mappings (specified as 829 830REGEXP:FORMATSTRING) may be defined, separated by commas. 831 832## 833 834NOTE: Due to a limitation of the configuration format, commas may 835 836not be used in the regular expression portion of each mapping. 837 838Commas “in the raw” may not be used in the format string portion, 839 840either, but you can probably use the URI-encoded form of the comma 841 842(“%2C”) instead with no ill side-effects. If you must specify a 843 844colon character in either the regular expression or the format 845 846string, escape it with a preceding backslash (“:”). 847 848## 849 850Example: 851 852custom_log_formatting = 853 854artf[0-9]+ : http://example.com/tracker?id=\\0, 855 856issue ([0-9]+) : http://example.com/bug?id=\\1\u0026amp;opts=full%2csortby=id 857 858## 859#custom_log_formatting = 860 861default_file_view: “log”, “co”, or “markup” 862 863Controls whether the default view for file URLs is a checkout view or 864 865a log view. “log” is the default for backwards compatibility with old 866 867ViewCVS URLs, but “co” has the advantage that it allows ViewVC to serve 868 869static HTML pages directly from a repository with working links 870 871to other repository files 872 873## 874 875NOTE: Changing this option may break compatibility with existing 876 877bookmarked URLs. 878 879## 880 881ALSO NOTE: If you choose one of the “co” or “markup” views, be sure 882 883to enable it (via the allowed_views option) 884 885## 886#default_file_view = log 887 888http_expiration_time: Expiration time (in seconds) for cacheable 889 890pages served by ViewVC. Note that in most cases, a cache aware 891 892client will only revalidate the page after it expires (using the 893 894If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match headers) and that browsers 895 896will also revalidate the page when the reload button is pressed. 897 898Set to 0 to disable the transmission of these caching headers. 899 900## 901#http_expiration_time = 600 902 903generate_etags: Generate Etag headers for relevant pages to assist 904 905in browser caching. 906 9071 Generate Etags 908 9090 Don’t generate Etags 910 911## 912#generate_etags = 1 913 914svn_ignore_mimetype: Don’t consult the svn:mime-type property to 915 916determine how to display a file in the markup view. This is 917 918especially helpful when versioned images carry the default 919 920Subversion-calculated MIME type of “application/octet-stream” (which 921 922isn’t recognized as viewable type by browsers). 923 924## 925#svn_ignore_mimetype = 0 926 927max_filesize_kbytes: Limit ViewVC’s processing of file contents in 928 929“markup” and “annotate” views to only those files which are smaller 930 931than this setting, expressed in kilobytes.

By default, ViewVC will look for templates in the 1377 1378directory specified by the “template_dir” configuration option (see 1379 1380the documentation for that option for details). But if you want to 1381 1382use a different template for a particular view, simply uncomment the 1383 1384appropriate option below and specify the currect location of the EZT 1385 1386template file you wish to use for that view. 1387 1388Templates are specified relative to the configured template 1389 1390directory (see the “template_dir” option), but absolute paths may 1391 1392also be used as well. 1393 1394## 1395 1396If %lang% occurs in the pathname, then the selected language will be 1397 1398substituted. 1399 1400## 1401 1402NOTE: the selected language is defined by the “languages” item in the 1403 1404[general] section, and based on the request’s Accept-Language 1405 1406header. 1407 1408## 1409 1410diff: Template used for the file differences view. 1411 1412## 1413#diff = 1414 1415directory: Template used for the directory listing view. 1416 1417## 1418#directory = 1419 1420error: Template used for the ViewVC error display view. 1421 1422## 1423#error = 1424 1425file: Template used for the file contents/annotation view. 1426 1427## 1428#file = 1429 1430graph: Template used for the revision graph view. 1431 1432## 1433#graph = 1434 1435log: Template used for the revision log view. 1436 1437## 1438#log = 1439 1440query: Template used for the non-integrated query interface. 1441 1442## 1443#query = 1444 1445query_form: Template used for the query form view. 1446 1447## 1448#query_form = 1449 1450query_results: Template used for the query results view. 1451 1452## 1453#query_results = 1454 1455revision: Template used for the revision/changeset view. 1456 1457## 1458#revision = 1459 1460roots: Template used for the root listing view. 1461 1462## 1463#roots = 1464 1465##————————————————————————— 1466[cvsdb] 1467 1468enabled: Enable database integration feature. 1469 1470## 1471#enabled = 1 1472 1473host: Database hostname.

It is from this already-reduced data set that ViewVC 1527 1528builds the query response it presents to the user, which may or may 1529 1530not include still more limiting via the query form’s ‘limit’ 1531 1532parameter. In other words, there is no value which the user can use 1533 1534in the query form’s ‘limit’ parameter which will cause more data to 1535 1536be returned by the database for ViewVC to process. 1537 1538## 1539#row_limit = 1000 1540 1541rss_row_limit: Maximum number of rows returned by a given query to 1542 1543the database made as part of an RSS feed request.

For example, you might have your web server configured to 1585 1586accept incoming traffic for both http://www.yourdomain.com/ and 1587 1588http://viewvc.yourdomain.com/. Users pointing their web browsers at 1589 1590each of those two URLs might see entirely different content via one 1591 1592URL versus the other, but all that content actually lives on the 1593 1594same computer, is served up via the same web server, and so 1595 1596on. It just looks like its coming from multiple servers. 1597 1598## 1599 1600ViewVC allows you to customize its configuration options for 1601 1602individual virtual hosts. You might, for example, wish to expose 1603 1604all of your Subversion repositories at http://svn.yourdomain.com/viewvc/ 1605 1606and all your CVS ones at http://cvs.yourdomain.com/viewvc/, with no 1607 1608cross-exposure. Using ViewVC’s virtual host (vhost) configuration 1609 1610support, you can do this. Simply create two vhost configurations 1611 1612(one for each of your hostnames), then configure the cvs_roots 1613 1614option only for the vhost associated with cvs.yourdomain.com, and 1615 1616configure the svn_roots option only for the vhost associated with 1617 1618svn.yourdomain.com. 1619 1620## 1621 1622This section is a freeform configuration section, where you create 1623 1624both the option names and their values. The names of the options 1625 1626are then treated as canonical names of virtual hosts, and their 1627 1628values are defined to be comma-delimited lists of hostname globs 1629 1630against which incoming ViewVC requests will be matched to figure out 1631 1632which vhost they apply to. 1633 1634## 1635 1636After you’ve named and defined your vhosts, you may then create new 1637 1638configuration sections whose names are of the form 1639 1640vhost-VHOSTNAME/CONFIGSECTION. VHOSTNAME here is the canonical name 1641 1642of one of the virtual hosts you defined under the [vhosts] section. 1643 1644Inside those configuration sections, you override the standard 1645 1646ViewVC options typically found in the base configuration section 1647 1648named CONFIGSECTION (“general”, “option”, etc.) 1649 1650## 1651 1652NOTE: Per-vhost overrides may only be applied to the following 1653 1654sections: 1655 1656## 1657 1658general 1659 1660options 1661 1662utilities 1663 1664templates 1665 1666cvsdb 1667 1668authz-* 1669 1670## 1671 1672Here is an example: 1673 1674## 1675 1676[vhosts] 1677 1678libs = libs.yourdomain.*, .yourlibs. 1679 1680gui = guiproject.yourdomain.* 1681 1682## 1683 1684[vhost-libs/general] 1685 1686cvs_roots = 1687 1688svn_roots = svnroot: /var/svn/libs-repos 1689 1690default_root = svnroot 1691 1692## 1693 1694[vhost-libs/options] 1695 1696show_logs = 1 1697 1698## 1699 1700[vhost-gui/general] 1701 1702cvs_roots = cvsroot: /var/cvs/guiproject 1703 1704svn_roots = 1705 1706default_root = cvsroot 1707 1708## 1709 1710##————————————————————————— 1711 1712ViewVC recognizes per-root configuration overrides, too. To 1713 1714override the value of a configuration parameter only for a single 1715 1716root, create a configuration section whose names is of the form 1717 1718root-ROOTNAME/CONFIGSECTION. ROOTNAME here is the name of the root 1719 1720as defined explicitly in cvs_roots or svn_roots or implicitly as the 1721 1722basename of a root path in root_parents. Options found in this new 1723 1724configuration section override for this one root the corresponding 1725 1726options found in the base configuration section CONFIGSECTION 1727 1728(“options”, “authz-*”, etc.) as interpreted after per-vhost 1729 1730overrides (if any) have been applied. 1731 1732## 1733 1734NOTE: Per-root overrides may only be applied to the following 1735 1736sections: 1737 1738## 1739 1740options 1741 1742utilities 1743 1744authz-* 1745 1746## 1747 1748WARNING: Do not use per-root overrides if your ViewVC instance is 1749 1750served via the standalone.py server option! Doing so could cause 1751 1752ViewVC to be unable to function properly (or at all). 1753 1754## 1755 1756Here is an example showing how to enable Subversion authz-based 1757 1758authorization for only the single root named “svnroot”: 1759 1760[root-svnroot/options] 1761 1762authorizer = svnauthz 1763 1764## 1765 1766[root-svnroot/authz-svnauthz] 1767 1768authzfile = /path/to/authzfile 1769 1770## 1771 1772##————————————————————————— 1773[authz-forbidden] 1774 1775The “forbidden” authorizer forbids access to repository modules, 1776 1777defined to be top-level subdirectories in a repository. 1778 1779## 1780 1781NOTE: The options in this section apply only when the ‘authorizer’ 1782 1783option (in the [options] section) is set to ‘forbidden’. 1784 1785forbidden: A comma-delimited list of patterns which match modules 1786 1787that ViewVC should hide from users. 1788 1789## 1790 1791You can use a simple list of modules, or something more complex: 1792 1793## 1794 1795*) The “!” can be used before a module to explicitly state that it 1796 1797is NOT forbidden.

You may want to also post your problem at http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/rancid/ might get someone better than me :) Check the areas where you had to modify permissions like the cgi-bin folder (Apache should be the owner here)\n1[root@rancid ~]# ls -l /var/www/cgi-bin/ 2total 8 3-rwxr-xr-x. 1 apache apache 1782 Jan 1 05:55 query.cgi 4-rwxr-xr-x. 1 apache apache 1781 Jan 1 05:55 viewvc.cgi Also what Python version are you running? In this example it was:\n1[root@rancid ~]# python -V 2Python 2.7.5 Check to make sure you have RCS installed:\n1[root@rancid ~]# yum install rcs 2Loaded plugins: fastestmirror 3Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile 4* base: mirror.raystedman.net 5* extras: mirror.netdepot.com 6* updates: mirrors.kernel.org 7Package rcs-5.9.0-5.el7.x86_64 already installed and latest version 8Nothing to do I would also try to run rancid manually and have it connect to a device to see if you can get diffs just in CLI. That would help because then its likely something wrong with just Apache/ViewVC. What I'll do is do a fresh install of Rancid on Centos 7 and see if I run into this problem, but I won't be able to really look at until next week sometime.\nGood Luck and don't get too frustrated ;) Ryan\nRyan - Mar 5, 2015\nIn this version I'm using Rancid 3.1 with Expect version 5.45. I have not experienced any of the hangs like mentioned above. The TCL version I'm using is 8.5.13. Maybe its fixed? Just in case if anyone wants to check: To check the Expect version run: expect -v To check TCL version go type tclsh followed by typing info patchlevel Thanks for bringing it up :)\nConfiguring Rancid « Cisco Skills - Feb 5, 2015\n[…] my last post I talked about installing Rancid on Centos 7 so be sure to check that out. In this post we now want to actually use Rancid so I’ll walk through […]\nRyan - Jan 5, 2016\nHey Adam, I would check your viewvc.conf file and make sure you put the database you are connecting into the view.conf file in my example my database is ViewVC. The error message basically says there is no database selected when you run the rebuild script. Configure the ViewVC configuration file nano /usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/viewvc.conf Look for database_name = Type in your database to connect ViewVC.

Your ViewVC is located under /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ where in this post ViewVC is installed under usr/local/. Can you run a sanity check on ViewVC? (This runs a small web server on the system) /usr/local/viewvc-1.1.23/bin/standalone.py -r /usr/local/rancid/CVS On your system it might be: /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/viewvc/bin/ standalone.py -r /usr/local/rancid/CVS Does that say any errors? Should report back as saying: server ready at http://localhost:49152/viewvc I would just do a curl to see the HTML document curl http://localhost:49152/viewvc The output should display HTML code if it is working. Hope that Helps, Ryan\nRyan - Nov 1, 2015\nHey Abhinav, Permissions look right as I just checked on my sample box but it just sounds like some type of permission issue It might be something with the viewvc.conf file. Can you verify that you made the correct changes as what I have outlined below. Try that. Ryan Find the following and edit as shown below:\n1… 2## Example: 3## cvs_roots = cvsroot: /opt/cvs/repos1, 4## anotherroot: /usr/local/cvs/repos2 5## 6#cvs_roots = cvs: 7 8## svn_roots: Specifies each of the Subversion roots (repositories) on 9## your system and assigns names to them. Each root should be given by 10… 11## Example: 12## root_parents = /opt/svn: svn, 13## /opt/cvs: cvs 14## 15root_parents = /usr/local/rancid/var/CVS : cvs 16 17## default_root: This is the name of the default root. Valid names 18… 19## Example: 20## rcs_dir = /usr/bin/ 21## 22rcs_dir = /usr/local/bin 23 24## cvsnt: Location of cvsnt program. ViewVC can use CVSNT (www.cvsnt.org) 25… 26## use_rcsparse: Use the rcsparse Python module to retrieve CVS 27## repository information instead of invoking rcs utilities [EXPERIMENTAL] 28## 29use_rcsparse = 1 30… Ryan - Feb 2, 2016\nHey Adam, You have to un-commented these out by removing the \u0026quot;#\u0026quot; symbols.

(;) instead of a colon (:)? If you are using newer versions of rancid this needs to be a semi-colon in the router.db. It's awesome that you are using a custom script to support other network devices however I'm have not used Cisco SB switches so the only thing I would look at is the cloginrc file. The missing close-brace error is usually means there is a brace \u0026quot;{\u0026quot; that is open still in your cloginrc file. Good Luck Ryan\nRohit - Mar 4, 2016\nGreat guide ! amazingly detailed ! thanks for the same.\nI have setup rancid, followed all the steps.

Finally i executed the /usr/local/rancid/bin/rancid-run command. This brought up all the devices UP in the repositories I created in CVS. all good.\nBut the configuration is not being pulled by rancid. I checked logs and found the messages as below.

This is a network simulation platform that you can run Cisco operating systems on which are the same operating systems that run on Cisco hardware so anything you do in this simulation environment would be realistic if it was running on dedicated hardware. You would be able to test your changes before throwing them in production. Some things that are different between VIRL and CML (Cisco Modeling Labs)\nCML is Cisco TAC supported so you can call Cisco. With VIRL you have community to help you out. You have cap of 15 devices with VIRL. The CML version capacity is dependent on the hardware its running on. CML is for the \u0026quot;Big Guys\u0026quot;, and way more expensive. VIRL is just for personal/training use. (i.e CCNA, CCNP, CCIE) To be upfront I have not purchased VIRL so I can't tell you my thoughts on the product itself but personally I think this is great way to learn and study Cisco certifications when looking at CCNP and even CCIE. This is way cheaper than buying hardware or renting rack space. The price is $199.99 a year and I would assume this would cover any updates the product has. Cisco is also selling an Academic Version for $79.99 a year with some extra terms attached to it. I'm curious if anybody has any thoughts on VIRL, what advantages do you think this network simulation program (VIRL) has compared to GNS3? What do you think VIRL's target audience is? Is this price too high? Finally do you think the product is too green? Are you going to buy it or wait and see?\nComment below.

GNS3 is an open source tool that helps network professionals run a virtual network right on their computer, GNS3 is not a simulation program but rather an emulation program. So if you wanted to test a configuration change but did not want to run it on production you can run it in GNS3 instead. This gives network professionals testing without touching any physical hardware or purchasing that expensive test lab for certification studies. Let's get started. Like I mentioned I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and installing GNS3 in Linux can be a little difficult if you are just not that familiar with it. I'm giving credit to Chris Welsh as he wrote out a nice script that installs everything you need to get started using GSN3, so installing it's pretty easy. Check out the post on GNS3 Jungle: Installing GNS3v1 on Linux. Follow those instructions and you should have GNS3 shortly. Once installed you need to have router images handy or router platforms that can run in VirtualBox like the CSR 1000v, remember GNS3 is the framework or 'glue' that makes running these images possible as well as connecting them together to form a virtual network. If you have Cisco router images handy you can run them in GNS3 now, check out the compatibility list here: Hardware emulated by GNS3. It also worth noting that most of these images are older and are end of life from Cisco's perspective. You must bring your own Cisco router images to run into GNS3.To be organized you should create some folders that store IOS images, If you installed GNS3 with Chris's script it created some folders in your home drive, GNS3-\u0026gt;Images-\u0026gt;IOS store your router image in that folder. To import a Cisco router image into GNS3: Edit-\u0026gt;Preferences, a new window opens. Go to Dynamips, select the down arrow, IOS routers and select new. A new window opens, browse to your router image, click next. Verify the platform and name if you want, (I'm just accepting the defaults) and select next. Verify what the image needs for RAM, following the link to Check minimum requirements., select next. Choose what network adapters you want on the router, this could vary depending on what you are testing, select next. Choose what WIC modules you want if any, again this could vary depending on what you are testing, select next. Choose and Idle-PC value if you know one, if not select Finish. You can have GNS3 calculate a valid value when the image is running by right-click Idle-PC (I tried to have it find one from the wizard but it error out. Checked the bug report of GNS3 and its a know issue) Close out of the Preferences Window by selecting Apply followed by Ok to save changes. You now have loaded a Cisco Router into GNS3! EDIT: 11/10/2014 - If you are on Windows use the following steps below to configure IOU. Linux users if you used Chris's script IOU is already installed without the need of VirtualBox/VMware see the following comment. Another cool feature in GNS3 1.1 is IOU which is enables switching, just like the Cisco router image you must supply your own. To to get GNS3 setup to support IOU we need to download the latest GNS3 IOU and import that into Virtualbox/VMware. which was installed automatically thanks to Chris's script. You can download the IOU VM at GNS3's Sourceforge page: GNS3 IOU VM and save the ova file into the GNS3-\u0026gt;Images-\u0026gt;IOU folder. Setup IOU on GNS3: Like mentioned IOU or Cisco IOS on Unix is also a good technology that is available on GNS3. Just like supplying the router image you also need to apply the IOU images as well as an IOU license file. IOU is popular because of the available switching (Layer 2) as well as IP routing (Layer 3). Open up Virtualbox and go to File-\u0026gt;Preferences, a new window will open, go to network option-\u0026gt;tab over to Host-Only-Adapters, add a host only adapter and select Ok. In Virtualbox and go to File-\u0026gt;Import Appliance, browse to the GNS3 IOU VM that you downloaded and select Next. Accept the defaults by selecting next, and when finished importing start-up the GNS3 IOU VM. Once the VM is online look for the IP address of the VM on the Login banner, in this example the VM IP address is 192.168.56.101. Keep note of the address. (For reference to login into the VM the username is root and the password is cisco) To verify the GNS3 IOU VM is working open up your browser and type in the IP address of the VM, such as the IP address I have is 192.168.56.101. So in my browser I would type the following: http://192.168.56.101:8000/upload and should get a webpage like below. Next you'll need a license file referenced for IOU to work, this is something you supply and in GNS3 you would go to Edit-\u0026gt;Preferences-\u0026gt;IOS on UNIX While in preferences go to GNS3 Server-\u0026gt;tab over to Remote Servers and add the IP address of the GNS3 IOU VM. We now need to upload our IOU image, again this is supplied by you and not GNS3. Just to be organized, I would put your IOU images in the IOU folder under the GNS3-\u0026gt;Images-\u0026gt;IOU path.Go to the GNS3 IOU VM webpage and select Browse followed by selecting upload. Depending on the size of the file it may take a couple of minutes. Once the upload is complete you will see your file in the GSN3 IOU VM and a path to get to it, keep note of that path. Go into GNS3 Preferences-\u0026gt;IOS on UNIX-\u0026gt;tab over to Server Settings and uncheck Always use the local server. While we are under IOS on UNIX hit the down arrow and select-\u0026gt;IOU Devices and select new, a new window opens. In our example this is a remote server, select next. Type in a name that is familiar to you, the path to the IOU image that you kept note of, and if the IOU image is a L3 or L2 image, select finish. Verify it and apply it. Believe it or not but that's it, Cisco IOU is running now running in GNS3. I hope this tutorial is helpful and like always comment below if you have one also be sure to also check out the links that I mentioned as its all of helpful material. So...what are you loading into GNS3? Comments: Ryan - Nov 1, 2014\nHey Anubisg1, So for some reason I did not even think about using IOU natively even though its installed by Chris's script.... Thanks for pointing that out. The steps above work for Windows for reference on the Ubuntu you need to do the following before to get IOU working, if not you will get the following error \u0026quot;32-bit binary support is probably not installed\u0026quot; sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386 sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0:i386 sudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.4 Reference: http://forum.gns3.net/post34810.html#p34810\n#### [anubisg1](http://journey4ccie.wordpress.com \"andrea@opensuse.org\") - Nov 6, 2014\rYou are running gns3 on Linux, why are bothering to use an external virtual machine to run IOU?

I'm excited for this release although the last post I did was In May of 2014, which was about getting GNS3 Alpha 3 working on Windows, you can see the full post here: GNS3 Alpha – Install and Setup. I have followed the GNS3 releases throughout the six months of them releasing Alpha and beta releases, as well as looking at changlogs of each release.\nSo over the past six months we have seen some changes with the GNS3 team. The new logo, the new website, and of course the new 1.0 version of GNS3. They have also done a good job of setting up a new portal called the GNS3 Jungle which is for the community to ask all things networking all of which is available now. Check out all of it at http://www.gns3.com/. Currently the GNS3 website is a little slow because I think we are all excited for the new software and can't wait to get our hands on it but I was able to register so I'll be posting more about the new version of GNS3 so keep that in mind, and check me out the GNS3 Jungle lewiryan.\nThanks again Stephen and Jeremy and the entire GNS3 team for building a great piece of software with the help of an awesome community.

Along the way I was into some new territory as I never stood up vPC before, so in this post I have posted some things to keep in mind and running-config examples, all of which I hope is helpful for a reference.\nBefore we go into the configuration of vPC I wanted to mentioned that the Nexus 5600 series switch is a newer product in the Cisco Data Center portfolio. I would guess that it would eventually replace the 5500 Nexus switch series but as of this writing Cisco has not put any end of life notice on the 5500 hardware. One of the main differences on the 5600 is the built-in layer 3 capabilities. The 5500 required a layer 3 card that used an expansion slot and only the higher-end Nexus products offered layer 3. To find out more information about the 5600 on Cisco's website: Cisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches Data Sheet\nSo when I was looking at configuration examples I noticed some confusion between a dual-homed FEX setup and an enhanced vPC setup, so I'll try to clear the air. The \u0026quot;Enhanced\u0026quot; vPC is able to set up an etherchannel link from two different Nexus switches. The host/server that connects to these two different Nexus switches must support Active/Active NICs. This configuration is almost the same if you were setting up a dual-homed FEX but with just Active/Passive NICs setup on the host/server. So here is a question if the configuration is almost the same what needs to be added to support enhanced vPC? The software I am working with is version 7.0(1)N1(1) and we need to enable the features of vpc, fex and lacp.\n1feature vpc 2feature fex 3feature lacp We also need to have some VLANs created on both 5ks. In this example I created 25-35\n1vlan 25-35 We need to start a VPC domain, this must be the same on both switches.\nSWITCH 1: 1vpc domain 1 peer-keepalive destination 169.254.1.2 source 169.254.1.1 SWITCH 2: 1vpc domain 1 peer-keepalive destination 169.254.1.1 source 169.254.1.2 A note about the peer-keepalive, the 5500/5600 Nexus has a dedicated management NIC card on the front of the unit. (Where the power is) The reason I did this was I did not want to waste a 10Gb connection for just a keep-alive link. (Although it can be done :/ ) In this example I don't have a \u0026quot;dedicated\u0026quot; management network so I decided to use the management NIC of both 5ks. By default you have a another vrf context called management on the 5ks running-config. So on both 5ks I give that vrf context an IP address and directly connected both 5ks together.\nSWITCH 1: 1interface mgmt0 vrf member management ip address 169.254.1.1/24 SWITCH 2: 1interface mgmt0 vrf member management ip address 169.254.1.2/24 Another helpful tip that I could not find out was if the management NICs would auto MDI/MDIX. So I just plugged in a straight-though and it works, so you don't need a crossover cable if you don't have one nearby. :)\nWe now need to create a vPC peer-link between the two Nexus switches. In this example I am using two 10Gb links, which are the same interfaces on both Nexus switches. (Consistency is your friend)\n1interface Ethernet1/31 2 channel-group 1 mode active 3 4interface Ethernet1/32 5 channel-group 1 mode active Both switches are referring to port-channel one for interfaces 31 and 32. In the port-channel we will trunk the vlans we have created earlier along with setting this port-channel into a vpc peer-link.\n1interface port-channel1 2 switchport mode trunk 3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 25-35 4 vpc peer-link To keep the config short I am only referring to two FEXes in this example. (Remember so far in this post you would do exactly the same configuration if you just wanted to set up dual-homed FEXes) Starting with FEX 101 on SWITCH 1:\n1interface Ethernet1/1 2 description FEX-101-PORT-1 3 switchport mode fex-fabric 4 fex associate 101 5 channel-group 101 6 7interface Ethernet1/2 8 description FEX-101-PORT-3 9 switchport mode fex-fabric 10 fex associate 101 11 channel-group 101 12 13interface port-channel101 14 switchport mode fex-fabric 15 fex associate 101 16 vpc 101 Continue with FEX 101 on SWITCH 2:\n1interface Ethernet1/1 2 description FEX-101-PORT-2 3 switchport mode fex-fabric 4 fex associate 101 5 channel-group 101 6 7interface Ethernet1/2 8 description FEX-101-PORT-4 9 switchport mode fex-fabric 10 fex associate 101 11 channel-group 101 12 13interface port-channel101 14 switchport mode fex-fabric 15 fex associate 101 16 vpc 101 Start with FEX 102 on SWITCH 1:\n1interface Ethernet1/3 2 description FEX-102-PORT-1 3 switchport mode fex-fabric 4 fex associate 102 5 channel-group 102 6 7interface Ethernet1/4 8 description FEX-102-PORT-3 9 switchport mode fex-fabric 10 fex associate 102 11 channel-group 102 12 13interface port-channel102 14 switchport mode fex-fabric 15 fex associate 102 16 vpc 102 Continue with FEX 102 on SWITCH 2:\n1interface Ethernet1/3 2 description FEX-102-PORT-2 3 switchport mode fex-fabric 4 fex associate 102 5 channel-group 102 6 7interface Ethernet1/4 8 description FEX-102-PORT-4 9 switchport mode fex-fabric 10 fex associate 102 11 channel-group 102 12 13interface port-channel102 14 switchport mode fex-fabric 15 fex associate 102 16 vpc 102 So we have just setup two dual-homed FEXes on the 5672UP switches, here is where we can kick it up a notch to set up enhanced vPC. If I had a host that plugged into FEX 101 and FEX 102 and I wanted to set up etherchannel so that host could send traffic on out both links I would put the following configuration on BOTH switches:\n1interface eth101/1/1, eth101/1/2 2channel-group 2 mode active 3interface eth102/1/1, eth102/1/2 4channel-group 2 mode active 5interface po2 6switchport access vlan 25 Here is the result, this is now an enhanced vPC. Some key points of this setup is be consistent with your configuration, it all has to match on both switches otherwise expect problems to arise. Enhanced vPC offers some high level redundancy, by just looking at the picture below you could have multiple failures and servers and applications would still be accessible. This makes this type of setup a common practice if business needs demand it. So I'll stop it there like before I hope this information is helpful as a reference. Feel free to comment below if you have any questions.\nStatic Comments: John Naggets - Apr 5, 2015\nWhat about using the QSFP ports instead of the Ethernet1/31 and Ethernet1/32 to connect both switches together using vPC, would that also work?\nRyan - Apr 5, 2015\nHey John, Yes I would think that would work. However I don't know if I would use the QSFP ports for a vPC link. Those type of ports would be better for uplinks. I don't think you would be running that much traffic thorough a vPC link unless something is wrong. From what I looked at it seemed like you would want to balance it out. So for example if I had an uplink on 5k-1 to Core-1, I would also want an uplink on 5k-2 going to Core-1. That way the traffic does not need to go through the vPC unless there is a problem. Hope that helps.\nJoel - Dec 2, 2014\nHello, are you sure of your drawing ? have a look at Fig 6-10 on ^this CISCO page : http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/mkt_ops_guides/513_n1_1/n5k_enhanced_vpc.html\nZak Post - Jan 3, 2015\nThanks for this, it was easy to follow up to get a working configuration.\nRyan - Jan 3, 2015\nGlad you were able to use it. :)\nNishant - Sep 5, 2015\nThanks, I found your post really helpful. I am in the process of implementing eVPC on 5672 UP. I have few questions with respect to the same, 1.You had mentioned that the host/server that connects to these different Fexes must support Active/Active NICs, does it mean that the host or server should support LACP? What if my host doesn't support LACP? 2.Can I dual home a VMware ESXi (active-active NICs on route based originating virtual port ID load balancing policy) to the fexes? … 3.Can I configure the fex port channel to static ( mode on) instead of active or lacp ? interface eth101/1/1, eth101/1/2 channel-group 2 mode on interface eth102/1/1, eth102/1/2 channel-group 2 mode on interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 Thanks in advance, Nishant\nRyan - Dec 2, 2014\nHey Joel, Thanks for pointing that out I fixed the image and thanks for the reference.\nRyan - Jan 1, 2015\nHey Kerry, Yes you would be able to add 4 ports in a port-channel to the FEXes. You could almost do the same thing with two 5600s without the FEXes if you wanted. Just setup a VPC and port-channel on both 5600s instead of using the FEXes.\nKerry - Jan 1, 2015\nThank you for this write up, great information. In my setup the host has 2 10g NICS for a total of 4 uplinks. Would I be able to follow your example here for PO2 but add in all 4 ports? (Ex 101/1/1-4 and 102/1/1-4\nRyan - Sep 1, 2015\nHey Nishant, You don't have to have Active/Active on the FEXs, you can have a single uplink from a host to a FEX and treat it like a standard port. The example that I showed is something you could do if you had a host that supported LACP. I also believe you can turn off LACP if you needed to and manually put up a port-channel on the FEX. Here is some more info: (Figure 6-5) http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/mkt_ops_guides/513_n1_1/n5k_enhanced_vpc.html\nJohn - Jan 6, 2016\nDoes this setup really need 8 network connections between the two nexus 5k and the two nexus 2k? Would it also work with only 4 network connections instead? and in that case would it still be called \u0026quot;dual homed\u0026quot;? I am not sure to understand the advantage of 8 network connections.\nRyan - Jan 6, 2016\nHey John, You could use 4 connections instead of 8 you just loose the amount of bandwidth available instead of 40Gbps you would have 20Gbps that is available to the 2ks. It would also still be called a dual homed setup because that 2k switch is connected two different 5k switches. Ryan.\nhostingnuggets - Apr 0, 2016\nRyan, I was wondering when connecting your server redundatly on Po2 shouldn't you specify a VPC? For instance you have: interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 but as far as I understand shouldn't it be assigned a VPC, for example: interface po2 switchport access vlan 25 vpc 2 ?\nRyan - Apr 1, 2016\nYou are correct if you would have connected the server directly to the 5ks you have to specify a VPC or if you had a single FEX connected to the 5k. In this example however I'm using FEXes which already have a VPC configured from both 5ks and I'm using port-channels off of those FEXes this is called \u0026quot;Enhanced vPC\u0026quot;. There is a difference between them, when you create an Enhanced vPC you don't specify a VPC on the FEXes because there is already a vPC created upstream.

To me QoS was a very interesting but after a chapter or two we never mentioned it again or really knew how to configure it. It seemed like it disappeared but it always something being tested on so we know it was there, somewhere… QoS can be a little boring and it does get a reputation of being difficult to understand, like where and how do I implement QoS? Most of the time QoS is not configured which causes applications to suffer in the end have an impact of end user performance.\nThrowing bandwidth to fix the problem is usually a costly risk, and remember you still may have the same performance problems. What also makes it interesting is you may have an environment that runs fine without QoS, so why do you need it? Well there's no easy button to fix or find these unanswered questions about QoS. In this post I'm referencing guidelines of where to start looking which will hopefully help answer some of those unanswered questions. :)\nA good place to start is at RFC 4594, (Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes) which provides an industry best practice on QoS. These are not standards that the RFC published but a good FYI. One of the reasons why RFC 4594 is not a standard is to work with what the individual business requires. For example VoIP/Video may not be the number one priority in the network for some businesses, an example could be a hospital. Life-saving hardware is number one. Cisco has even made a slight change with RFC 4594 by switching the Call-Signaling and Broadcast Video markings to CS3 and CS5.\nCrawl, walk, run is the method Cisco recognizes as not all enterprises are ready for such a complex QoS design. Starting from a phased approach is often more successful than an all-in one approach. (Rome wasn’t built in a day) Looking at the three different classes below, it would be much simpler to start at a 4-Class model and work our way up if the business needs demand it.\nKeep in mind that depending on the hardware you are running there are different types QoS syntax, like MLS QoS, MQC, and C3PL. These all have different QoS capabilities depending on the type of QoS syntax you're using. Catalyst 2960/3560/3750 are the last platforms to use MLS QoS.\nQoS is disabled by default and must be globally enabled with the mls qos command. Once enabled, all ports are set to an untrusted port-state. Catalyst 3650/3850 and 4500 are using MQC (Modular QoS Command Line)\nQoS is enabled by default. All ports trust at layer 2 and layer 3 by default. Catalyst 6500/6880 is using the Cisco Common Classification Policy Language (C3PL)\nQoS is enabled by default (Sup2T) – Disabled by default (Sup720) All ports trust at layer 2 and layer 3 by default. C3PL presents queuing policies similar to MQC. Some key points: The primary role of QoS in campus networks is not to control latency or jitter (as it is in the WAN/VPN), but to manage packet loss. In GE/10GE campus networks, it takes only a few milliseconds of congestion to cause instantaneous buffer overruns resulting in packet drops. Rich media applications, particularly HD video applications are extremely sensitive to packet drops, to the point where even 1 packet dropped in 10,000 is visible by the end-user. Always perform QoS in hardware and not software when the choice exists. Classify and mark applications as close to their sources as technically and administratively possible. Police unwanted traffic flows as close to their sources as possible. Enable queuing policies at every node where the potential for congestion exists. I hope this information is helpful in at least getting started in QoS. Feel free to post any questions or your experience in QoS.

However the last session on the last day of the Cisco Live talked about Cisco’s Modeling Lab program. I also tried it out in the Cisco DevNet area earlier in the week during Cisco Live and I was impressed with the product. When does CML release? Well during the session it was said to wait for about 60 days, which would put this release towards the end of July/August time frame hopefully. ;)\nProduct is an OVF template that support Windows and MAC computers using VMware’s Player or Fusion depending if you are on a Windows PC or Mac computer. (I would guess VMware Workstation would also work :) ) For the personal/developer edition Joel Obstfeld who was the presenter in this session said the product will be available for free under the Cisco DevNet Program with community support and an unlimited number of devices. (Depends on the hardware you have) I also came across some information on CLN and Mostly Networks that under the DevNet program the software would stay to be called VIRL, but under the corporate version this product would be called Cisco Model Labs 1.0. The personal edition will collect data like what kinds of devices are lunching and features you are activating as well as statistics all of which would be sent over plain text. Joel did mention that configuration information would not be sent over. What are your thoughts on CML? Links:\nCisco Modeling Labs\nCisco DevNet\nCisco Live Day 1\nEDIT: As of 9/25/14: I have not been able find much information about CML/VIRL and it seemed like it dropped off. :( However for corporate customers CML is alive and available if you want to pay for it. I was able find some information from Shaun who is a Systems Engineer for Cisco. (Cisco Modeling Labs 1.0: First Impressions \u0026amp; Getting Started)In his post he mentions VIRL but does not have official date and it would most likely be released with the Cisco DEVNET program....

The Loganalyzer application offers searching of various syslogs, all of which is open source and available to download. In this guide I will go through the steps to get these two applications to work together and in the end of this tutorial we should have a working syslog system ready to take logs! The operating system I am using is the latest CentOS 6.5 minimal. Let's get started.\nUsing VMware Workstation the first thing I have done is installed a minimal version of CentOS on the VM. The VM has 30GB on the disk with one processor and two cores with 2GB of RAM. (Which took about 10 minutes to install) Once the VM rebooted I login into the root account and ran the command yum update and accepted all the updates the operating system was able to find (Which took about 10 minutes) Let’s first added some housekeeping packages like wget and nano yum install wget nano .The minimal install does not include wget, or nano. Nano is a good text editor for people who don’t want to use VI :) I have also disabled iptables (service iptables stop \u0026amp; chkconfig iptables off ) in this demo but this is not recommend in a production environment.\nFIRST: Let’s install apache:\n1yum install httpd Start the Service:\n1service httpd start Let’s make sure the service automatically when the server reboots:\n1chkconfig httpd on Let’s test to make sure you can get to the sample webpage, http://your-server-ip-address if it is working should look something like this. SECOND: Install MySQL:\n1yum install mysql mysql-server After install is finished start it up:\n1service mysqld start Like apache, let’s make sure this service starts when the server reboots:\n1chkconfig mysqld on For security change the MySQL Admin password:\n1mysqladmin -u root password \u0026#39;YourNewPassword\u0026#39; Let’s Test MySQL, by logging into the database:\n1mysql -u root -p Did you get something like below?\n1Welcome to the MySQL monitor.

FOURTH: Install Rsyslog, A couple things first, CentOS uses an older version of rsyslog, so why not use the latest stable version of rsyslog.\n1wget http://rpms.adiscon.com/v8-stable/rsyslog.repo 2mv rsyslog.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/rsyslog.repo 3yum install rsyslog\\* --skip-broken When the server reboots let’s start this service automatically.\n1chkconfig rsyslog on Rsyslog has a createDB script in the following location: /usr/share/doc/rsyslog-mysql-8.2.1/createDB.sql, you can leave this alone or you can optionally change the database name. (Don’t be boring) In this example I changed it to rsyslogdb (… still a little boring)\n1nano /usr/share/doc/rsyslog-mysql-8.2.1/createDB.sql 2CREATE DATABASE rsyslogdb; 3USE rsyslogdb; 4CREATE TABLE SystemEvents 5[...] Let’s create the rsyslogdb database:\n1mysql -u root -p \u0026lt; /usr/share/doc/rsyslog-mysql-8.2.1/createDB.sql Should be able to access the database:\n1mysql -u root -p rsyslogdb For security add a dedicated administrator called rsyslogdbadm for only this database with a password of what you want.\n1GRANT ALL ON rsyslogdb.* TO rsyslogdbadmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \u0026#39;NewPasswordHere\u0026#39;; 2FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 3exit Did it all work? Let’s test logging in and exit mysql.\n1mysql -u rsyslogdbadmin -p rsyslogdb\\ Uncomment the following modules in the rsyslog.conf (Located in /etc/rsyslog.conf) file and add the MySQL module line.\n1# Provides UDP syslog reception 2# for parameters see http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/imudp.html 3module(load=\u0026#34;imudp\u0026#34;) # needs to be done just once 4input(type=\u0026#34;imudp\u0026#34; port=\u0026#34;514\u0026#34;) 5 6# Provides TCP syslog reception 7# for parameters see http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/imtcp.html 8module(load=\u0026#34;imtcp\u0026#34;) # needs to be done just once 9input(type=\u0026#34;imtcp\u0026#34; port=\u0026#34;514\u0026#34;) 10 11# Load the MySQL Module 12module(load=\u0026#34;ommysql\u0026#34;) You may also want to edit the Rules section to disable logging to the console, in this example I said log only syslogs that have a level of emergency to the console.\n1#### RULES #### 2 3# Log all kernel messages to the console. 4# Logging much else clutters up the screen. 5*.emerg* Also note that rsyslog logs everything it sees to a log folder by default as well. If you are using LogAnalyzer to view logs like in our example we are storing those logs in a MySQL database as well. Depending on how much logging you have you may either want to disable this and have LogAnalyzer do it all or setup a cron job to drop these once in a while.\n1# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher. 2# Don\u0026#39;t log private authentication messages! 3*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none /var/log/messages 4 5# The authpriv file has restricted access. 6authpriv.* /var/log/secure 7 8# Log all the mail messages in one place. 9mail.* -/var/log/maillog 10# Log cron stuff 11cron.* /var/log/cron 12 13# Everybody gets emergency messages 14*.emerg * 15 16# Save news errors of level crit and higher in a special file. 17uucp,news.crit /var/log/spooler 18 19# Save boot messages also to boot.log 20local7.* /var/log/boot.log In the forwarding rule add the following, this tells rsyslog to send all syslogs to the MySQL database.\n1# ### begin forwarding rule ### 2# Let\u0026#39;s forward all logs to the MySQL Database 3*.* :ommysql:127.0.0.1,rsyslogdb,rsyslogdbadmin,YourPassword 4… Save and exit the configuration file and restart the Rsyslog service to load the new configuration.\n1service rsyslog restart You should now have some logs in MySQL Database, check it by using the following:\n1mysql -u rsyslogdbadmin -p rsyslogdb 2 3mysql\u0026gt; select count(*) from SystemEvents; 4+----------+ 5| count(*) | 6+----------+ 7| 2 | 8+----------+ FIFTH: Download the LogAnalyzer web application,\n1wget http://download.adiscon.com/loganalyzer/loganalyzer-3.6.5.tar.gz Unpack the tarball:\n1tar zxvf loganalyzer-3.6.5.tar.gz Copy the install files into Apache.\n1cp -r loganalyzer-3.6.5/src/ /var/www/html/loganalyzer 2cp -r loganalyzer-3.6.5/contrib/\\* /var/www/html/loganalyzer/ Let’s go into those folders:\n1cd /var/www/html/loganalyzer/ Add some execution permission to these files:\n1chmod +x configure.sh secure.sh Run the ./configure.sh, which will create a blank config.php file as well as set write access.\n1[root@localhost \\]# ./configure.sh To complete the install of LogAnalyzer we have to following the prompts on the web. Browse to http://your-server-ip-address/loganalyzer You should get an error page like below. Select the here link to start the install.\nLoganalyzer will do a couple of tests to verify configuration click next to start them. Select Next if the config.php file can be written. In the Basic Configuration use the following image below to reference your installation. The next page is to create tables in the MySQL database go ahead and select next. The next page displays any errors if any SQL Results failed, select next if you don't have any failed statements. In step 6 we create a main user account to log into the LogAnalyzer web app. In step 7, we create our source for syslog messages, follow the image below for a reference. Looks like we are done the select the \u0026quot;here\u0026quot; link to go to the login page. Done! Some last things to check with LogAnalyzer is it does DNS lookups of IP address which can slow down the website if you have a lot of IPs in your logs. To disable that feature go to Admin Center -\u0026gt;Uncheck Resolve IP Addresses using DNS.\nI have personally pushed up to 500 syslog messages every 10 seconds thanks to the Kiwi Syslog Generator and did not see any performance hits other than the DNS issue. Hope this information is helpful, let me know if you have used LogAnalyzer in a production environment, are there any gotchas? I have just been testing it on my lab and so far so good.\nLinks: CentOS MySQL RSYSLOG LogAnalyzer\nStatic Comments: Md.

I know things have changed between Centos 6.5 and 7 so what might work with Centos 6.5 may need some tweaking in Centos 7. I have personally not tested Loganalyzer on Centos 7, I would guess it works but that is only a guess. I would also use the latest stable software versions that are available for LogAnalyzer and RSYSLOG. This looks to be a permission issue with apache, I would verify apache has rights to write the config.php file. Hope that Helps, Ryan\nJan Stasik - Oct 3, 2015\nHI Frank, I had same issue.

I'm not doing anything that difficult with the program so maybe I'm not breaking it in all the way but I also was looking at some installation notes for Ubuntu and other Linux flavors, I figured I’ll try to install it on a Windows machine and not Linux (call me lazy) feel free to follow this guide. To install GNS3, here is what I had\nWindows 7 Professional x64 bit with the latest Microsoft updates Downloaded GNS3 Early Release 1.0 – Alpha 3 (Must be a member) Oracle VM Virtual Box installed (latest version 4.3.10 and only if you are going to use IOU) Downloaded GNS3-1.0-alpha3 IOU VM (Only if you are going to use IOU) Since this is an all and one installer it was pretty easy to install, and I decided to install all the components that the all-in-one had to offer.\nWinPCAP 4.1.3 Wireshark 1.10.7 Dynamips 0.2.12 VPCS 0.4b2 GNS3 SuperPutty 1.4.0.4 beta I accepted the default destination folder and installed it, once installed I used by GNS3 membership to activate the software. That's it you now are running the Alpha version of GNS3. If you wanted to try IOU that is where it can get tricky, remember GNS3 is a platform that can support IOU and Dynampis. IOU are images that Cisco created to run on Unix, the reason IOU is popular is because it supports layer two (switching) functionally. Before GNS3 1.0 only supported layer three (Routing) and very limited layer two (switching) functions. However IOU is not available to the public. Dynampis is an emulation technology that older Cisco router images can run on but you are still in the same situation as you were before which is Cisco does not give public access to these images. The GNS3 team are working on trying to get an IOU image for GNS3 before the end of the year when GNS3 goes public, but since this is an alpha version of GNS3 and only available to members its currently only a problem for members that are testing out IOU. I would suspect towards the end of the year this won't be an issue. If you have an IOU image feel free to continue the steps below. :) We now need to import the GNS3 IOU VM that we downloaded into virtual box.\nStart virtual box Go to File-\u0026gt; Import Appliance Browse to the OVF file that you downloaded and select next and accept the defaults by selecting import. When you first start the VM you may get an error about the network interface accept the warning and make sure the VM is only using the host-only adapter. Once the VM is online we need to do some verification, for the username you will use root and the password is cisco. When at the shell type ifconfig eth0 to get the IP address of the VM. Keep note of the IP address. The next step is to import your IOU image into the GNS3 IOU VM.\nType the IP address of the VM into your browser followed by the 8000 port number. (Example http://192.168.1.1:8000/upload ) Browse your local computer for the IOU image file and select upload. You should get a message of where the file is stored on the Linix VM when the upload is successful, keep note of that location. Open up GNS3 and in the preferences.\nGo to Server-\u0026gt;Remote Servers and add the GNS3 IOU VM to the list, the default port number is 8000 Select the IOS on UNIX option and browse to the path of your license key (Path to IOURC) which is needed to activate the IOU image. Finally we need to set the IOU image path that was uploaded to the GNS3 IOU VM.\nSelect the IOU devices option in the GNS3 preferences and in the IOU path type in the path of the IOU device that you keep note of and select save. (Example: /home/gns3/Documents/GNS3/images/linux-iou.bin ) You now have a working IOU in GNS3, Go ahead and try it out. If you want more information about GNS3 or if you are a member and having some issues go check out the GNS3 forms. I hope this information that I provided helps as well. Comments: Ryan - Oct 5, 2014\nHey Guellord, Did you check to make sure you have the network settings setup in Virtualbox? Not sure what you are using but edit the machine and make sure you are using a host-only adapter. You should not have to login to get an IP address it should be in the login banner if you are using the latest GNS3 IOU. Hope that Helps.

Chapter 12 talks about redundant switched technologies and chapter 13 talks about security. Just like before I will go over the high-points, so let’s get started!\nChapter 12 Overview: In this chapter we get to learn about Spanning Tree Protocol and some history with it. With networks we like multiple ways to a destination however in the layer two area redundancy does not play well and that’s where spanning tree can help us. So know what spanning tree and its purpose. Spanning tree has several terms that are important to remember for the exam, I would look over page 387. For the exam know some show commands for spanning tree, like show spanning-tree, and show spanning-tree summary. This chapter also talked about the different types of spanning-tree but could not tell if this would be on 640-911 exam as well as port-channels which helps eliminate blocked STP ports. :)\nChapter 13 Overview: In the last chapter of 640-911 book we get introduced to access-control-lists and the types of access-lists that the NX-OS supports, know the difference as well as configuring a standard access list and extended access list also be sure to understand the implicit deny statement at end of every access-list. I would also know how wildcard masking works, (flip the subnet mask). A couple more things I thought would be important to keep an eye out is understand that once an access-list is created that does not mean its active, make you sure to understand how to apply the ACL on an interface. Finally know your show commands for access-lists, like show access-list and show access-list summary.\nOverall thoughts: So thanks for checking out these posts about the 640-911 exam, I hope this give you an idea of what to expect on the exam and good luck, if you decide to take it. Personally I am shooting for May/June timeframe to pass at least the 640-911. I thought this book was helpful but if you went and passed the CCNA or even CCNP it does get a little dry in areas. This exam is introductory but required if you wanted to achieve the CCNA Data Center certification. Remember you need to pass two exams 640-911 and the 640-916 to become CCNA Data Center certified. Check out all the 640-911 exam topics: 640-911 Exam Topics\nA little off topic but interesting to note is as of this writing Todd Lammle is the only author that has published a study guide for the CCNA Data Center, a quick check on Amazon shows that Cisco Press is ready to roll out an official certification guide for the 640-911 in the end of August authored by a Wendell Odom, followed by the 640-916 in January of 2015. I’ll end it here, I hope this information is helpful and comment below if you have any questions on these chapters.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/04/19/640-911-chapter-12-13/","section":"post","tags":["CCNA Data Center","Cisco","cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","networking","Nexus","NX-OS","STP","switching","technology"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 12 \u0026 13)"},{"body":"Just like before if you have followed, I have gone over the CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle and in this post we cover two chapters. Feel free to comment below if you have any questions on either of these two chapters.\nChapter 10 Overview: Chapter 10 starts us back in the book, before we do any configuring and we learn about routing protocols, and remember the difference between static and dynamic routing (name implies it) Also know the default administrate distances of the different routing protocols (starts on page 297). We also got a crash course in distance vector, link-state and hybrid routing protocols. Out of RIP, RIPv2, EIGRP and OSPF where does each protocol belong? Know the differences between RIP and RIPv2 (there is a couple of them) Know what EIGRP does and it available features it offers as well as OSPF.\nMy thoughts: This chapter went over the dynamic routing protocols and at a fundamental level but in important one to remember not to just pass the exam but to also go further. There was a lot of good information in Chapter 10 about dynamic protocols. If you have never used/learned about dynamic routing protocols make sure you understand the chapter and go over the review questions.\nChapter 11 Overview: Chapter 11 looks at layer two switching technologies, we get to learn about frame tagging or also called VLANs, make sure you understand how 802.1Q works. We also looked into some configuration options like learning how to set up a trunk link, VTP options and SVIs. Know what the type of modes VTP offers, and what is required when setting up VTP what needs to match? With SVIs know how to enable them and what they are used for because it’s not just a management port. (Hint: Router on a Stick)\nMy thoughts: We went from Layer 3 in the OSI back to Layer 2, we need to know the difference between VLANs as we start to blur the lines when using Router on a Stick configurations. This chapter covered the basics of VLANs an important step to make sure you understand the fundamentals. Same things goes with this chapter, if you have never used/learned about VLANs, VTP, SVIs make sure to go over the chapter and review questions. Short and sweet, please post any questions if you have any about this chapter, I hope this information is helpful.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/04/16/640-911-chapter-10-11/","section":"post","tags":["640-911","CCNA Data Center","Certification","Cisco","cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","networking","Nexus","NX-OS","technology"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 10 \u0026 11)"},{"body":"Back where we left off, if you have followed I have gone over the CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle and in this post we will cover two chapters 8 and 9. Comment below if you have any questions on these two chapters let's get started.\nChapter 8 Overview: We are actually making some progress, we configure the NX-OS with CLI there is not a GUI that I am aware of although SDN could be kind of in there but for this exam it does not even exist. Remember the ways to connect to the NX-OS for configuration and verification this is the same with IOS devices, Console, Telnet, SSH and Auxiliary. Just like IOS we can erase the entire NX-OS switch to factory settings by using the write erase boot, along with using the same commands available in IOS. (Copy run start, erase start config) In the exam we need to understand and add SVIs, remember to turn on that feature. The NX-OS brings two user roles out of the box without implementing any access-control when logging into the NX-OS you can have network-operators and network-admins, know the difference between these two. Just like IOS learn how to use the help functions available in the NX-OS along with knowing how to create a hostname and finally the know the advantages of using SSH and the requirements to set up SSH.\nMy thoughts: This chapter went over how to get started in configuring and setting up the Nexus. It reminded me of on old post I did for IOS about Basic Router Configuration. This chapter just got you close enough to touch the hardware and turn it on but not really run it.\nChapter 9 Overview: Changing some gears in this chapter we learn about IP Routing we get a crash course in this. This chapters talks about the IP Routing process. How does the packet get from point A get to point B. Look over page 278 carefully to make sure you understand it also be sure to understand the role of the MAC address. I also thought it was interesting of how the routing table looks in NX-OS when comparing it to IOS devices on page 277, I would also study this.\nMy thoughts: Chapter 9 had some key areas for the IP routing if you are familiar with the CCNA this would be a good refresh course, chapter 10 will get us familiar with routing protocols. Like always I hope this is helpful, comment below if you have any questions.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/03/30/640-911-chapter-8-9/","section":"post","tags":["CCNA Data Center","Cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","Cisco IOS","networking","NX-OS"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 8 \u0026 9)"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco-systems/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cisco Systems"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/fex/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"FEX"},{"body":"I previously had the chance to play around with the 5596UP switch, and made some notes on how to configure inter-vlan routing.

However in this post let's go back to the basics and configure inter-vlan routing on a nexus switch and in this case I am using a 5596UP. In this example I have already configured a FEX port with a 2k check out the my earlier post Connecting FEX (5k to 2k) so let's start right after that and login into the 5k.\n1User Access Verification 2demo5k login: admin 3Password: 4Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software 5TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac 6Copyright (c) 2002-2013, Cisco Systems, Inc.

Comment below if you have questions in this chapter, last week we learned about subnetting and in this chapter we will learn about the NX-OS which is Cisco's Data Center switches. Let's begin! Overview: This was short chapter in introducing the NX-OS product line and into the virtualized enviroments that data centers are now becoming. In this chapter you will discover that Cisco wants all traffic both SAN and LAN unified on one switch instead of being separate devices. The NX-OS is a Linux system with some pretty neat isolation features with the data and control plane separated and the ability to offload crunching to dedicated CPUs instead of sharing the load. I also liked how the system manger worked, it reminds me of a watchdog making sure everything is running in par and the ability to restart processes with automatic restart thanks to PSS. (Persistent Storage Service) Being able to upgrade the software and still being able to forwarded traffic is also very cool, thanks ISSU (No downtime around here :) ) I hinted on an earlier post that the Nexus runs on efficiency and only loads what it needs or configured, why load up NTP if you are not going to use it? Know some common process that can run on the NX-OS like STP, CDP, and HSRP. All of these have to be turned on before you can use them. Some other cool things you can do is VRF which separates the routing table for multi-tenancy or for security requirements. Finally being able to a VDC (virtualized dedicated device) which is able run another copy of the NX-OS on the same hardware and depending the model of Nexus hardware you are using you can run up to eight different systems! **My thoughts: **Very cool stuff going on in the Cisco world, if you never heard of the Nexus and this is first time reading this chapter what does this remind you of? We know that servers took a huge movement into virtualization to combat server sprawl. The Nexus is attempting a similar approach to add to their portfolio. What is interesting to me is the Nexus was first introduced in the beginning of 2008, which makes the NX-OS product six years old. For the exam go over the chapter and review questions as always ask questions if you have any by commenting below.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/02/27/640-911-chapter-7/","section":"post","tags":["640-911","Certification","Cisco","cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","Data center","networking","technology"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 7)"},{"body":"Let's start chapter six of the CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle, feel free to post questions if you have any. Like before I have covered the topics of the each chapter. Last week we learned about the different IP classes and today we get a course in subnetting. Let's go over what you should know if you want to pass the exam.\nOverview: It seems I have talked subnetting to death on this blog, repetition, repetition, repetition. So known the advantages of subnetting why would you use it along with knowing what IP subnet zero is. You also should be able to take a classful network and break it into smaller networks some math is involved but it's not rocket science, if you get lost go over it again you'll start seeing pattern when subnetting. Since we are subnetting, know the purpose of the subnet mask that's associated with the IP address. Also be sure you can explain what CIDR is and the difference between a classful network.\nMy thoughts: If you have been around with subnetting you can probably glance over this chapter but I would go over the labs that start on page 190. There is also some more information about subnetting on this blog you can find:\nPart 1\nPart 2.\nAlso another good site for sharping subneting skills is subnettingquestions.com . Believe it or not we have finished the back story to finally get to what we want to know which is Cisco's data center switches the NX-OS product line. I have mention this before at the start of the series, if you know the material have a CCNA or just been around routing and switching you could have glanced over these earlier chapters. This exam starts at the beginning and if you want to move into CCNP you must have passed the 640-911 and the 940-916. Let's continue to see what the 640-911 exam topics have to offer.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/02/20/640-911-chapter-6/","section":"post","tags":["640-911","CCNA Data Center","Cisco","cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","networking","Nexus","technology"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 6)"},{"body":"Last week we covered chapter four which talked about the TCP/IP and the DoD models and what role they cover in networking as we learned that every application like FTP, DNS, DHCP depend on it. Like always post questions if you have any about the book CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle. I'll continue to cover topics of each chapter of the book, plus any examples the book offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover. Let's go over chapter five.\nOverview: I think we knew it was on the way, in this chapter we opened the door to IPv4 addressing. If this is your first time understanding IP addresses go over it carefully, this exam will cover it. Know the ranges of a Class A, B and C networks, where's the loopback? Also know the private IP class ranges of A, B and C. (RFC1918) Know the difference between broadcasts, unicast, and multicast addresses. We also got introduced into IPv6, know the address format, the short hand way to write an IPv6 address as well as the types of IPv6 addresses. (link-local, unicast, global unicast addresses, and unique local address)\nMy thoughts: If you have been around IPv4 addresses you might be good on this chapter, towards the end of the chapter I would look at IPv6, we don't talk about subnetting yet that's next week. :) Pretty short chapter this week post questions below if you have any on this chapter.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/02/13/640-911-chapter-5/","section":"post","tags":["640-911'","CCNA Data Center","Certification","Cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","Data center","Internet Protocol","IP address","networking","technology"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 5)"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/internet-protocol/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Internet Protocol"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ip-address/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IP address"},{"body":"Continuing where we left off on Chapter 3 on CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle. Like before feel free to post questions below. In these post I am only going over the topics of each chapter of the book, plus any examples the book offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover. In chapter three we discussed about Ethernet Technologies and in chapter four we will learn about the TCP/IP protocol which is fundamentally the protocol that makes the Internet work.\nOverview: The chapter started talking about the DoD model and comparing it to the OSI model, remember this and a little history behind it as well as the layers the DoD model shows its relevance with the OSI model. We start talking about applications like Telnet, FTP, SMTP what are these? Know the common applications and their port numbers. The chapter also talked about host-to-host layer protocols like TCP and UDP, know the difference between these two, and some memorization of what the TCP and UDP header looks like. (Which one is unreliable and which one uses acknowledgments and flow control?) We also looked into the Internet layer Protocols, do you know them all and their functions? Also know what the IP header looks like. (What does it include?)\nPersonal Story: I wanted to jump in and talk about my personal experience with TCP/IP protocol mainly the ICMP management of it. I was contracted with a company that had a Cisco Phone System and a 2900 router using SiP as well as Internet on top it. They had this time clock system that would send punches over a VPN to a corporate office and it was setup and working for a while until of course it eventually stopped sending time punches. This took about a week to figure out as the VPN was online and you could contact the device from corporate. With a SPAN port I could see traffic hitting the time clock as well as it coming back. The issue was when the 2900 router was setup, it was set to disregard ICMP (For general network security) because of the way the time clock is designed it would use ICMP to decide the acceptable MTU size before sending time punches. Since it never got a reply it would fail on sending time punches, in the end I enabled the router to accept ICMP to fix the issue. Long story short, ICMP is a management protocol for IP and although it can be used against you, it's a balancing act between security and functionally and in this case the time clock used ICMP legitimately, lesson learned. :)\nMy thoughts: Personally I liked going over this chapter it starts to put some pieces together, I would read it over if you have seen this before just lock down any missing parts. Also post any questions about this chapter below.\nCould be Helpful? 640-911 Exam Topics (PDF)\nUnderstanding TCP\nUnderstanding UDP\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/02/06/640-911-chapter-4/","section":"post","tags":["640-911","CCNA Data Center","Certification","Cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","Cisco Systems","Data center","Internet Protocol","IP address","networking","technology"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 4)"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ccnp-security/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"CCNP Security"},{"body":"Cisco recently published its 2014 Annual Security Report, and some interesting data was captured in 2013. One of the details was a talent gap in network security and because of this gap Cisco has a major revision in the CCNP Security certification starting in April. Its estimated that in short term or already present is shortage of more than a million security professionals worldwide! Like mentioned because of this Cisco is reworking the CCNP Security track. Let's get into the details of the changes coming in April 22nd 2014. One thing I noticed is the exam names themselves such as the old exams are specifying Cisco's own technologies to solve these security issues.\n642-637 (SECURE) Securing Networks with Cisco Routers and Switches. 642-618 (FIREWALL) Deploying Cisco ASA Firewall Solutions. 642-648 (VPN) Deploying Cisco ASA VPN Solutions. 642-627 (IPS) Implementing Cisco Intrusion Prevention System. The refreshed exam looks at the overall picture of security instead of throwing in a specific box to solve your problem along with knowing how to administrate the device. The new exam names are:\n300-208 (SISAS) Implementing Cisco Secure Access Solutions 300-206 (SENSS) Implementing Cisco Edge Network Security Solutions . 300-209 (SIMOS) Implementing Cisco Secure Mobility Solutions. 300-207 (SITCS) Implementing Cisco Threat Control Solutions. This alignment goes together with the new material of the Associate level exam (CCNA 2.0 Is what I'm calling it :) ) What is also interesting is Cisco is retiring alot of the Security Specialist exams on April 22nd 2014, below is a list of exams and their last day to test.\nCisco ASA Specialist - April 21st 2014 Cisco Firewall Security Specialist - April 21st 2014 Cisco IOS Security Specialist - April 21st 2014 Cisco IPS Security Specialist - April 21st 2014 Cisco Network Admission Control Specialist - April 21st 2014 Cisco VPN Security Specialist - Aprial 21st 2014 In return Cisco is offering training for these specific products, I was unable to tell if completing these training courses tied to any new certifications. My guess is since Cisco is retiring these types of specialist certifications, these are just training materials to help you better understand Cisco's product line along with administrating the product. All of this is still pretty new information, the Cisco Learning Network will be having CCNP Tech Seminars stating February 4th and going through April 1st. All of this free to access by registering which would be incredibility helpful. CCNP Security Tech Seminars Like always I hope the above information is helpful.

In these post I am only going over the topics of each chapter of the book, plus any examples the book offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover. In chapter two we discussed about internetworking and in chapter three we will learn about Ethernet technologies.\nOverview: This chapter goes over what chapter 2 started we get more information on collision domains, broadcast domains, and introductions into CSMA/CD and the familiarity link between half and full-duplex ethernet. We also looked at the sections of a MAC address and what the IEEE is involved with assignment of these address when giving them to manufactures. We learned about how to convert binary to hexadecimal as well as vice versa. We also looked at the Data link layer and the fields associated with it.(Which part of the OSI model is that?)\nChapter 2 hinted on the cabling standards but we now have a list full of them starting from coaxial cable to single-mode fiber cable. (Which goes further?) We also learned which type of cable connects to what and how they are terminated. (Like devices use a crossover cable and not a straight-through cable) We finally talked about Data encapsulation and had some good examples at the end of the chapter of how a computer sends information on the network and it looks like more information is in Chapter 9 :) .\nMy thoughts: I would read this chapter even if you went through it before there is a lot of information that needs refreshed (at least for me) if you are going to take the exam.

I figured that this type of post would help me and anybody else looking at studying for the exam. Feel free to post questions below as if on a study group, In these post I am only going over the topics of each chapter of the book, plus any examples the book offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover. Continuing where we left off from chapter one let’s begin chapter 2.\nOverview: Chapter 2 goes over the difference between a broadcast domains and collision domains and how to find them. What does the \u0026quot;Router\u0026quot; do for us when using it in a LAN? What are the advantages of it and the functions it offers? We also were introduced into the OSI model. What is it and what are the advantages of it? Todd also went over each layer of the model with more detail on the Transport layer, Network layer and the Data Link layer. For example in the Transport layer we learned about the TCP and UDP and the difference between those two protocols. Along with understanding TCP's connection-oriented process, the three-way handshake. We also looked other features that TCP offers like what does flow control do for us? Along with understanding what windowing and acknowledgments are. Going from layer 4 to layer 3 we were introduced into the network addresses and what they do along with knowing some terminology like routing tables, interfaces, and metrics. Going down from layer 3 to layer 2 what is a frame vs. a packet and what is the difference between the Media Access Control (802.3) and the Logical Link Control (802.2) Finally at layer 1 this chapter talked a bit about the cabling standards but it lets you know why hubs are a layer 1 device and the difference between switch and a hub.\nMy thoughts: This chapter goes over a lot of material that was somewhat introduced in chapter one but goes further into details. I would study the OSI model and its different layers if you have never used it before. Like on chapter one I would go over the review questions starting on page 54 before skipping this chapter. Like before if you have questions on chapter two comment below and the check back next week for chapter three! I have posted before on this blog some items that would go along with this chapter:\nCollision Domains vs. Broadcast Domains The OSI Layer Understanding TCP Understanding UDP ","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2014/01/23/640-911-chapter-2/","section":"post","tags":["640-911","CCNA Data Center","Cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","Data center","networking","technology"],"title":"640-911 (Chapter 2)"},{"body":"So I bought the CCNA Data Center Study Guide from Todd Lammle. I have decided it would be a good idea to go over the topics of each chapter of this book in series of blog posts. The idea of this is to work together if on a study group, go over the topics in each chapter of the book, talk about examples and to get an idea of what the exam would cover. Below are my thoughts about chapter one.\nOverview: So when I read chapter one I had to remind myself this is an introduction into the CCNA Data Center exam, as I have talked before the 640-911 exam has no perquisites so we started at the beginning. Asking ourselves “What is a Network?” Todd does a good job in introducing us into these technologies, like understanding what a LAN, WAN is and the difference between these types of logical topologies. We also covered the most common types of network devices such as a workstations, servers, and printers and what function they do on the network. As well as understanding what a peer-to-peer network is and client/server network, when would you use these type of network architectures? We then finally jumped into the type of physical topologies like what a bus, star, ring, are and what are the pros and cons of each? At the end of this chapter you should understand the following:\nKnow the types of network topologies. For example what is the difference between a logical topology and a physical topology? Know the pros and cons of each topology. For example a Mesh topology vs. a Star topology? Understand the difference between a LANs and WANs. My thoughts: For this chapter it's a review if you went over some CCENT/CCNA study materials or have a CCENT, however don’t skip over this chapter. Instead I would check the review questions on page 23, if you do pretty well go over to chapter two. I have of hinted on this before if you have a CCNA or higher it may seem like a review but there are flakes of new material scattered into the exam and just enough to fail you if you decide to skip it. :) I hope this information will be helpful and if you have any questions on chapter one comment below.\nStatic Comments: Martin - Jan 4, 2014\nlooking forward to the new cert ,im CCNA certified and didnt want to tek the steep CCNP route just yet as im too busy at work ,this will definitely work for me\nRyan - Jan 4, 2014\nHey Martin, You an me are in the same boat :) Ryan\n640-911 (Chapter 2) « Cisco Skills - Jan 4, 2014\n[…] offers and to get an idea of what the Cisco exam would cover.

Since we have switches which run in separate collision domains per port we have to do some configuration on the switch first before we can analyze traffic. (Think back to Collision domains vs. Broadcast domains)\nIn this example I have a 24-port Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch with no configuration on it. I have two PCs that are connected to this switch, One PC (PC2) will be my destination of copied frames while the other PC (PC1) will be the source of those frames. PC2 will have Wireshark installed and be capturing the output, while PC1 will browsing the web and checking for windows updates. If all goes correct I should be able to see traffic that PC1 is sending and receiving from PC2.\nTo get started I am in global configuration mode and I will be using the “monitor session” command. The following command below tells the switch to copy frames on port FastEthernet0/5 which is where PC1 is physically connected.\n1Switch(config)#monitor session 1 source interface Fa0/5 I have to issue one more command which tells the switch where to send those copied frames and in this example I sending them to FastEthernet0/6 which is where PC2 is physically connected.\n1Switch(config)monitor session 1 destination interface Fa0/6 You can verify your SPAN port by issuing the show monitor session command.\n1Switch#show monitor session 1 2Session 1 3--------- 4Type : Local Session 5Source Ports : 6 Both : Fa0/5 7Destination Ports : Fa0/6 8 Encapsulation : Native 9 Ingress : Disabled 10 11Switch# After that is complete I have ran a wireshark capture on PC2 and you can check out the results here on cloud shark I only ran the capture for 78 seconds and had a total of 4551 packets!\nhttp://www.cloudshark.org/captures/8f1cd7661a1f\nThat’s it! You can also watch more than one network port to capture network traffic if you want, as well using it on port-channels but the 2960 I have does not support that feature :) Like always I hope this information is helpful and Happy New Year!

The gear I have is an evaluation unit so I made some notes and one thing I was impressed is how easy it is to connect a Nexus 5K to a Nexus 2k also known as a fabric extender. I have kept it simple as the gear I have is a single Nexus 5596 along with a single Nexus 224TP-E who needs redundancy right? So in this post I'll explain how to connect a 5k Nexus to a 2k extender. Let’s get started! So I needed a couple of SFPs as the only way to connect the 5k to the 2k is a FET-10G SFP along with that was some multimode fiber (OM3) with LC connectors. Looking at the simple diagram below our end goal is to be able to configure the 2k from the 5k. That is the point of the 2k extenders less switches to manage in the data center. Once we have made the physical connections lets power both switches on, we won't need to worry about the 2k switch at all as along we have a physical connection to a parent switch the 5k in our case, but that also could be 7k switch. Just an FYI, I've already ran through the simple CLI wizard to setup a username and password but other than that let's get configuring by entering the familiar command \u0026quot;config t\u0026quot; [code]User Access Verification demo5k login: admin Password: Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac Copyright (c) 2002-2013, Cisco Systems, Inc.

The Nexus runs on efficiency and only loads what it needs or configured. This is familiar approach that Linux uses which loads what is installed and nothing else. In the output below we can see all the features that the NX-OS supports followed by the command to turn on FEX.

The commands are petty simple, I first want to go into interface followed by changing the mode of interface and finally giving the interface a FEX associate ID. :!:NOTE: Since this design is a single stack we need to issue the FEX associate command on the physical interface. If you want redundancy you would usually put the FEX associate command with channel-groups and vPCs. Another helpful FYI is if you have channel-groups you don't need to put the FEX associate command on the physical interface.

The 2k has four FEX ports that can be connected to a 5k or a 7k, however in this example I did not issue a command that shows the FEX port status, I'll do some digging in finding an example but from what I can tell I think the \u0026quot;show interface fex-fabric\u0026quot; would show what uplink it is connected to and the status of the FEX link.

A lot of new features are on the list, like switching, cloud processing, hassle free configuration, labs/training materials and 3rd party integrations. All of which are in the works for this new version added along with some pretty cool plug-ins. As of writing this post they are at $106,973 dollars which is 300 percent over funded! A pretty good turnout in fact they meet their goal in less than 4 hours of stating the campaign and have 16 days left to go. GNS3 has had a history of being one of those free products that can be little overwhelming at first. However once you start looking into blogs, videos and other many helpful resources about GNS3 it becomes an amazing tool to simulate networks. In fact once you have verified/tested your configuration you could take that same running-config from GNS3 and paste into production, what free network simulation product does that? I have used GNS3 for the most part for studying Cisco certifications but just recently I have found that GNS3 to be very helpful in my current work environment as I am able to play around with network designs. I could also think of other ways to use GNS3 like for demo networks, poof-of-concept ideas, security projects and much more. From what I can tell from the ideas and features coming into version 1.0 I am hopeful that this version will be a game changer for GNS3 just as it was six years ago. If you have used GNS3 before go ahead and take a look at their campaign and see if you would like to contribute, or you can as always wait until it officially releases for free. If you never used GNS3 but have an interest go ahead and download the latest version of it, there is some good documentation on GNS3’s website on how to configure it as well other blogs and videos of how to install/configure. I hope this short post is informative and just for a FYI I’ve personally contributed to the GNS3 campaign. Good Luck Stephen and Jeremy! So with that what would you like to see in GNS3 1.0, and in future versions of the product? Also what has the current version of GNS3 helped you with? Comment Below!

In this tutorial I have two 2960 switches both of them trunking all VLANs on two gigabit ports. So in the end game is get 2gbps instead of 1gbps between switches while using Cisco’s proprietary protocol PAgb. It is important to remember that both of these protocols (PAgb and LACP) are link aggregation protocols only, their job is to make sure that EtherChannel is setup correctly by negotiating. This helps prevent EtherChannel mismatches and loops. You could manually set the etherchannel mode to \u0026quot;on\u0026quot; instead of using either of these aggregation protocols. However this is considered best practice to use one of these link aggregation protocols. Here are some Guidelines for Configuring EtherChannel:\nYou can configure the port in two ways: PAgp which is Cisco proprietary protocol. LACP which is an industry standard 802.3ad. You can combine from two links to eight links. All ports MUST be identical such as: Same speed that also includes duplex. Cannot mix and match Fast Ethernet and Gigabit ports. Cannot throw in PAgp and LACP in the same “channel”. Must be either all trunking or non-trunking. All links in the channel must be either in Layer 2 or Layer 3. If you want to use PAgp each side must be one of the two settings for the channel to come up. Auto-Desirable Desirable-Desirable If you would like to use LACP then each side must be one of the two settings for the channel to come up. Active-Active Active-Passive So for this example I have a two Cisco 2960 switches, one switch is a 24-port while the other one is a 48-port switch. I have already done some pre-configuring for the native VLAN (not using VLAN1) and I have also created an additional VLAN for data traffic on both of these switches. The two switches I am working with both have two gigabit trunk uplinks to each other, by default of STP one link will be in blocking state. To allow both of these links in a forwarding state follow the configuration below. On the 24-port switch under both gigabit interfaces: [code highlight=\u0026quot;3,4,5\u0026quot;] 24-SW3#configure t Enter configuration commands, one per line.

Cisco has a refreshed all the CCNA Routing and Switching exams. That includes the ICND1 (640-822), the ICND2 (640-816), and the all in wonder exam (640-816). You will notice some old references no longer mentioned on this refresh, so let's go over the differences and some of the changes Cisco has made to the associate-level certification track. Starting at the CCNA the refreshed exams are the following, 100-101 ICND1 (which replaces 640-822 exam), 200-101 ICND2 (which replaces 640-816 exam), and the all in wonder 200-120 CCNA (which replaces the all in wonder 640-802 exam). Like I mentioned earlier the last day to take these older exams are September 30th of 2013 so good luck :) What has changed:\nThe certification was formerly called CCNA is now called CCNA Routing and Switching with no prerequisites (Like before) If you wish to have advanced technology certifications like the CCNA Security, CCNA Voice, CCNA Wireless you must have at least a CCENT or CCNA R\u0026amp;S (Before you had to have CCNA) Expect these exams to have Router IOS version 15 instead of versions 12.4, expect more IPv6 information as IPv4 is depleted , and IOS licensing. No RIP version 1 or version 2 :( No WLAN information Some of the information that was in the ICND2 has shifted to the new ICND1 100-101. Also check out this MircoNugget with Jeremy Cioara to see some other detail about the new exams: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym3zBF4-2J0 You can find more information at Cisco's Newsroom, along with going to Cisco's Training \u0026amp; Certifications site and looking at the Associate Certifications area.

Getting those “aha moments” once in a while makes it worth it, but beyond just over all knowledge of additional technologies why would you go on taking a professional Cisco cert? I find these type of questions all over web, “Is CCNP worth it?” My answer is it depends on your current job situation. Let’s say you are in dead-end entry-level technical position, you’ve been there for a couple of years and for the most part your job hasn’t change. Would getting a CCNP automatically move you up those ranks? Probably not. You also have to look at the company you’re working for, is this just an average company, and all that is needed is a technical person or team depending on the size to support the environment? Would getting a CCNP be worth it, are you actually going to be using that knowledge you learned to better help the company? Or would that be wasted time and money? Let’s say you don’t have your foot in the door and you are right out of college or even high school would getting a CCNP get you noticed? Absolutely however I would not recommend getting a CCNP and then looking for a job. Start out with Network+ or CCENT get an entry-level position and start getting that experience that employers often look for. I know its easier said than done but for both of these situations and in my opinion if you can longer move up the ladder or the company is not focused or in need of CCNP knowledge, find a company that is before you start studying in the professional arena. I also think it depends on where you live physically are there actual companies in your area that are in need of CCNP candidates? Or would you have to move, and most importantly do you want to move? Unfortunately these are all questions that I would need answered before I would even start looking in the professional arena personally. Not to say CCNP is not rewarding, there usually is higher pay, and these professional certs have a proven track record in career advancements, gaining additional knowledge and finally staying up to date with current network technologies. You may even find yourself being contacted by company recruiters if your name is out there. In my opinion any body that passes any Cisco Certification has definitely made themselves noticeable but there has to be balance. Where do I stand? I think eventually I'll get there, but with my current position I'm pretty happy where I am. :) When putting this post together I was also reading a published a white paper that Cisco put out recently looking at the value of Cisco Certified Employees take a look at the linked PDF and like always I hope this information is helpful, comment below of what you think about of professional certs? Do you have any, have they helped out and are they worth it? What Is the Value of a Cisco Certified Employee?\nRelated articles VMware's new VCA: fab or flop?

So some searching around I decided to drive into power-shell to see if I could get something to work. One of my first problems was to find a way to have power-shell SSH into my devices I found out about SharpSSH which look interesting but I also found SSH.NET. So I went with my second choice and decided to try the SSH.NET module. I would not of went to far if I did not stumble across this website which helped out a lot. Here is the direct link of the Wiki page I was referring to. Also here is the code I quickly put together and I can bet there is a better way to setup this script but since I am pretty green when it comes to scripting this is what I could come up with. Feel free to edit and use, if you have suggestions on how to improve this script let me know by commenting below.

Remove-SshSession -RemoveAll # Close out of PowerShell exit [/code] I have tested this out and it works pretty good, I was able to test up to 12 devices at the same time. Since this script does not have any \u0026quot;if\u0026quot; statements and other smarts to it you do have to change a configuration option on your router or switch to go right into Privileged EXEC when the account logs in. This is done by usually saying privilege level 15 when setting up a user account on the router or switch. I hope this information is helpful and I will see if I can re-work this script as it is a work in progress with power-shell :) What are other ways to backup your configuration, what tools and or scripts have you used in the past?\nRelated articles SSH tip: Send commands remotely (reviews.cnet.com) What actually is required to get the configuration from a Cisco device?

Having the ability to get access to resources remotely without having to be at our office physically is a nice touch, you may even notice higher productivity and who doesn't want that! Networks have to be in a healthy state in order for people remotely and people at the office to get their work done. An unhealthy network at a business usually loses productivity and customers which in the end comes down to money. How do you know if your network is reaching its capacity along with the general health state of it? Let's look at some commands and general best practices! Your checklist to a healthy network is:\nNew areas of the organization should use switched technologies not hubs and shared bandwidth devices. (I would also look at replacing these) If your organization is using any WAN technology such as, T1s, T3s, Metro, etc. These WAN links should not be using more than 70 percent of network utilization. Anywhere in the organization from point A to point B the response time should less than 100ms. (1/10 of a second) In an organization's LAN response time should be less 2ms from point A to point B. No segments in the organization should have no more than 20 percent of broadcasts or multicast traffic. No segments in the organization have no more than one CRC (cyclic redundancy check) error per million bytes of data. No network device in the organization should be at or over 75 percent CPU utilization in a 5 minute interval. If so this is likely due a network problem such as, routing loops, STP problems, oversaturation of links etc. The number of output queue drops has not exceeded 100 in an hour on any Cisco router. The number of input queue drops has not exceeded 100 in an hour on any Cisco router The number of buffer misses has not exceeded 25 in an hour on any Cisco router The number of ignored packets has not exceeded 10 in an hour on any interface on a Cisco router. You can get most of this information with one command the show interfaces command on a Cisco router and or switch! Below is an example: [code highlight=\u0026quot;4,6,7,16,18,21,23,25,26,28,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,46,48,49,50,54,56,57,58,60,62\u0026quot;]GigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up --omitted-- MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000000 Kbit/sec, DLY 10 usec, reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255 !!

Received 1541471 broadcasts, 0 runts, 0 giants, 0 throttles !! Notice the amount of broadcasts, the percentage of this is 0.19 percent. 0 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored !! Notice the above, zeros here are are good sign. 0 watchdog, 1661275 multicast, 0 pause input 0 input packets with dribble condition detected 798111721 packets output, 3946323159 bytes, 0 underruns 2 output errors, 0 collisions, 1 interface resets !! Notice the above had (2) output errors along with (1) interface rest !! this is sometimes called a flap on the interface these errors are not !! repeating most likely happened when the interface flapped. 0 unknown protocol drops 0 babbles, 0 late collision, 0 deferred 2 lost carrier, 0 no carrier, 0 pause output !! Notice above had (2) lost carrier counts which means lose of electric !! signal on the interface this probably related to the (2) output !! errors and the (1) interface reset 0 output buffer failures, 0 output buffers swapped out !! Looks good to me. [/code] To show CPU stats of the router or switch a simple a command that I like to use to display a simple one liner result is show processes cpu | include five this basically cuts out the technical stuff because all I want to see is the CPU utilization. I also have choice to deep dive into it if I feel like it :) [code]Router#show processes cpu | include five CPU utilization for five seconds: 0%/0%; one minute: 1%; five minutes: 1%[/code] These are good steps to take to find the status of your network, you may find out that your network is good for years to come or you may find out and see problems with it. There's nothing wrong with refreshing your gear or changing up your network design that's your job right? Like always I hope this information is helpful, feel free to comment below with questions. Also I would be interested in seeing what commands you use on routers and or switches to see if trouble is on the horizon, or if it's already here!\nRelated articles EIGRP Advanced Concepts: EIGRP Fundamentals + Neighbor Relationship Review (ccieme.wordpress.com) Creating a Site to Site IPSec VPN with a Palo Alto Networks Application Firewall and a Cisco Router (nchrissos.wordpress.com) WAN Technologies and Cablings (professordkinney.com) Extremely Slow Network Speeds (community.spiceworks.com) ","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2013/07/19/is-your-network-healthy/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","cisco","Cisco Systems","Cyclic redundancy check","Input queue","networking","router","technology","tutorial","Tutorials","Wide area network"],"title":"Is Your Network Healthy?"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/wide-area-network/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Wide area network"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/aside/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Aside"},{"body":"Look at GNS3 - New Version: A new version of GNS3 released on July 5th 2013 is available for download.

New Idlemax and Idlesleep settings (advanced manipulation of IDLE PC). IOS image and settings test button. New Tool menu to start external scripts/tools. Drag \u0026amp; drop of multiple devices when pressing SHIFT. Temporary projects are created by default. VirtualBox interface numbering starts at 0 (e.g. e0 = VirtualBox interface 1 = eth0 on Linux). Support for 36 network cards in VirtualBox (using ICH9 chipset) New option to save traffic captures in project directories. Experimental auto IDLE PC calculation feature (requires Dynamips greater than 0.2.8-RC5, which is included in Windows all-in-one and OSX DMG). Added entries to have Dynamips/Qemu/VirtualBox hypervisors bind/listen to all available IP/host addresses (optional). AW+ router support by Allied Telesis from New Zealand (educational version of their OS to be released). Removed the “Save IOS configs option” in project settings. IOS configs are always saved. Qemu FLASH files are automatically saved in a directory named ‘qemu-flash-drives’ (in the project directory). Dynamips version 0.2.8 You can also read the changelog for a full list of changes! I have used GNS3 off and on with my certification studies, it has always been a great program for that \u0026quot;what if question.\u0026quot; Currently I am using if for some OSPF routing redundancy checks and some proof of concept designs. What are some good topologies for GNS3 have you seen?

I have studied off and on in the beginning of the year but I did set a date to take the exam which was June 28th .As that date was getting closer I buckled down and reviewed the materials again and focused in on some areas that I knew I was weak in.\nSo how was the 640-554 exam, what did I use to pass the exam and what exam am I focusing on next? The 640-554 exam that I took surprised me which left me at the edge of the seat the entire testing period! 8-O There where lot of difficult questions that I would have missed if I hadn’t of re-reviewed the study materials, along with the amount of questions I had to go through to meet the 90 minute deadline, but it was worth it! After I saw my passing score on screen it definitely was a fair score that I received. I did not feel cheated or have any questions that weren’t on the exam topic list, so I was overall pleased with the results.\nNow to question that is often asked, what materials did I use to pass the exam? I used the CCNA Security 640-554 Official Cert Guide authored by Keith Barker and Scott Morris which is an excellent study guide. I also used the CBT Nugget Series Cisco CCNA Security 640-554 which is also by Keith Barker to at first learn about the material, take some notes on it and then review it in the cert guide by going through the chapters, reviewing the questions that are in the beginning of the chapters, along with using the study material that was included in the book. I also had some lab gear that was helpful in either following along with the CBT videos or just building some test labs. The lab I have follows the one I posted back in September (Cisco Lab Setup)\nI also recently was able to get two more 2960 Cisco Catalyst switches. :) So what is my next plan? Not sure I might look at that new CCNA Data Center exam which was announced last fall and it also looked like they may have some study material for it, at least for first exam (640-911 DCICN). I might start on the CCNP journey but either way I am still planning on posting on this blog with tutorials, ideas and other stories. I am also happy that I was able to make some changes of the layout and color of this blog, I hope you enjoy the new look and like always I hope this information is helpful and enjoy your summer!\nStatic Comments: CCNA Version 2.0 Refresh « Cisco Skills - Jul 6, 2013\nRyan - Jun 6, 2013\nThanks, Good Luck on the CCDA, that is another exam I have been looking at as well.

In this lab I am going to post the running-config of both locations so you can either run it through Packet Tracer or live equipment if you wish. I am running two Cisco 2811s with Advanced Security Version 12.4(24)T8. Let's do it! Take a look at my setup, I am running in the RFC 1918 range on a closed track and \u0026quot;technically\u0026quot; have a third router in the middle just to route between the two serial interfaces to \u0026quot;simulate\u0026quot; the internet. Branch-1 does not know about the LAN on Branch-2, and Branch-2 does not know about the LAN on Branch-1. Our task is to configure a Site-To-Site VPN between the two remote Branch offices to be able reach the remote LANs. Before we jump right into it here is the running-config of both Branch routers before a VPN is setup so you can walk through this yourself.

Check out my Introduction into CCP which talks about what CCP is and goes through the some of the basics on how to discover devices. So for this example I already have CCP opened on a PC that is on Branch-1's LAN and have already discovered Branch-1. In CCP I want to create a site-to-site VPN so in order for that to happen I'll click Configure at the top of the program and expand the Security folder and select Site-To-Site VPN. Once we selected the site-to-site VPN option we are presented with a general overview of what a site-to-site VPN is and its functions. Our task is to create a site-to-site VPN so let us select the tab \u0026quot;Create a Site-To-Site-VPN\u0026quot; and then follow that by selecting \u0026quot;Launch the selected task\u0026quot; button. A window popup should appear something like picture below, basically giving you two options. The quick setup would probably work as it would generate a lot of default commands and if you have two Cisco routers at each end it along with running the quick setup on both ends, you would probably get a VPN up and running with very little configuration effort on your part. But for this guide I want to walk through the advanced setup and look at all the gears and knobs of a VPN. Let's continue select next. The next couple of options go over the IKE proposals (Internet Key Exchange) which is all about handling the way keys are passed between devices. So we are not even talking about data being passed yet, just ISAKMP. Since we are on Branch-1 we want to select our outside interface which happens to be the (1) serial interface 0/0/1. The next option is selecting who our peer is or where would we like to build a VPN tunnel which in this case its Branch-2 who's outside address is (2) 192.168.20.2. The final section is to create a (3) pre-shared Key that must match on both sides. It is best to create long pre-shared key in a production environment but since this is on a closed course I kept it short and simple, select next. Like mentioned their actually two tunnels being built for this VPN one of them is just the routers to talk amongst themselves to make sure they agree on the keys and secrets and a second one for data traffic to pass through. This IKE default proposal would work if Branch-2 had the same proposal on Branch-2 but let's create our own. Select Add. Another window shows and we are now configuring the IKE Policy, I decided to use (1) AES 256 bit encryption with (2) SHA 1 which is 160 bit hash we are using (3) shared secrets with a (4) Diffie Hellman group 2 and finally with a lifetime of 24 hours which is default. Select OK Now we can see our other IKE proposal that we created. Select Next. The next section is for our IPsec Tunnel which is the tunnel that our data goes through select add to create a transform set, I am going to call this set (1) \u0026quot;BRANCH-TRANS-SET\u0026quot; we are going to (2) check the integrity of data also called ESP. For the (3) Integrity Algorithm will be ESP SHA HMAC and the (4) encryption will be ESP AES 256. Select OK. Our Transform Set is created and we could create more if we wanted to. Let's select next This next section is what traffic would we like to protect with our recently IPec tunnel so we type our local LAN because we want to be able access the remote network (Branch-2's LAN) over our protected tunnel. Select Next. We have reached the summary screen which gives us an overview of what will about happen if we decide to deliver these commands by clicking Finish. Let's see what happens. Since this is treated like an internet connection I have setup a NAT/PAT rule to translate address to my serial interface on Branch-1. Basically CCP detected this rule and wants to change it. So for this example I will let CCP go ahead and make the change by selecting Yes. Here is a list commands CCP has generated to make my VPN tunnel a dream come true and is about deliver them. Let's deliver these commands! Unfortunately the tunnel is still down because we have to configure the other side which is Branch-2. We want to do the same thing we did on Branch-1 but change our peer to point to 192.168.20.10 (which is Branch-1's outside address) Add the same IKE Proposal and Transform-Set as did with Branch-1 onto Branch-2 and finally flip our traffic to protect. For the local network we put Branch-2's LAN and for the remote we put Branch-1's LAN. Once both sides are created they won't come up until that interesting traffic comes along either from Branch-1's LAN going to Branch-2's LAN or Branch-2's LAN going to Branch-1's LAN. So I have a PC on Branch-2 and to test this tunnel I am able to ping Branch-1's FastEthernet Interface (192.168.40.1) from 192.168.50.6 which is my PC.

I hope this tutorial is helpful and below you will find the running-config of both Branch-1 and Branch-2 's configuration of making this VPN work. Remember for a closed track you \u0026quot;technically\u0026quot; need another router in the middle of the branches but don't advertise the LANs. Go ahead and load it in Packet Tracer and or live equipment and give it shot you might have to reconfigure some settings deepening on your setup and Packet Tracer does not accept all of the commands. Good Luck and comment below if you have questions! I would be happy to answer them :) [code]#################################################################### ## START OF RUNNING-CONFIG FOR BRANCH-1 AND BRANCH-2 ## #################################################################### ## START OF CONFIGURATION OF BRANCH-1 ## !

In this post I am going to be going over the configuration steps of how to configure AAA locally on a Cisco router, (The same commands would also work on Cisco switch). To review what exactly AAA does check my earlier post Understanding AAA. Like mentioned in my earlier post of Understanding AAA it gets better if you have some type of radius or tacacs+ server. Let's at least take look at configuring it locally first and I'll be sure to include another post on configuring a radius and tacacs+ server. So I have a router called BRANCH-1 and below is the running-config. In this configuration you will notice a couple of things I first don't have aaa enabled. In this configuration I do a local username on the device called admin with a secret password, and on the VTY lines I have enabled the router to check the local database when connecting on those lines along with an enable secret password.

Well with AAA you can give users different permissions when accessing the device along with audit trail of who changed what or at least who accessed the device. So let's configure AAA with the defaults first then create our own method list for AAA which starts making AAA modular so that we can specify different ways to authenticate a user, along with authorize, and account for the user. In this post we will focus on different method lists for authentication. Let's move into Configuration mode on the device and to enable AAA we have to issue the command aaa new-model before we can configure anything. [code]BRANCH-1#config t Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. BRANCH-1(config)#aaa new-model[/code] If we type aaa authentication and put a question mark at the end you can see the available commands we can use. You can definitely customize a lot of features. :) [code]BRANCH-1(config)#aaa authentication ? arap Set authentication lists for arap. attempts Set the maximum number of authentication attempts banner Message to use when starting login/authentication. dot1x Set authentication lists for IEEE 802.1x. enable Set authentication list for enable. eou Set authentication lists for EAPoUDP fail-message Message to use for failed login/authentication. login Set authentication lists for logins. password-prompt Text to use when prompting for a password ppp Set authentication lists for ppp. sgbp Set authentication lists for sgbp. username-prompt Text to use when prompting for a username[/code] Let's focus on setting up the ability of logging into the device so if we type aaa authentication login we can see two options on BRANCH-1. The \u0026quot;WORD\u0026quot; option is what we will use when setting up a custom method list, for this example we will use the default method list. Which looks at the console, auxiliary lines and VTY lines. [code]BRANCH-1(config)#aaa authentication login ? WORD Named authentication list. default The default authentication list.[/code] So let's go through this command again with the following, aaa authentication login default and follow that by a question mark. We have a couple of options to work with on BRANCH-1. This basically wants to know what password do you want use? You could use the enable password, or use a server-group for radius or tacacs+ authentication and more. You could also use these methods for redundancy check let's say you use a server-group but it is unreachable if you don't have another method for login we won't be able to connect to this device. [code]BRANCH-1(config)#aaa authentication login default ? enable Use enable password for authentication. group Use Server-group krb5 Use Kerberos 5 authentication. krb5-telnet Allow logins only if already authenticated via Kerberos V Telnet. line Use line password for authentication. local Use local username authentication. local-case Use case-sensitive local username authentication. none NO authentication.[/code] For this example we are just going to use the local database that is stored on the router the running-config. So are command would be aaa authentication login default local. Which tells the router to use the default method list and the password we want to use is located on the router. [code]BRANCH-1(config)#aaa authentication login default local[/code] So what does this do? If we exit out of the router we will be prompted with login prompt at the console. We will also be prompted if we connected with telnet or SSH connection and be required to type a username and password before we get access to the device. [code]BRANCH-1 con0 is now available Press RETURN to get started. User Access Verification Username: admin Password:[/code] We can make our own method list, say for example we wanted the ability to not be prompted with a user name or password when we are connected to a console connection but be prompted when we attempt to connect with either telnet or SSH connection we can do that ;). We first have to create two authentication lists. The first one will be called OPEN-CON with none at the end which tells the router don't check anything for verification and just open it up. The second authentication list will be called LOCAL-DB with local at the end which checks the running-config for a username and password and it must match before it allows it any further. [code]BRANCH-1(config)#aaa authentication login OPEN-CON none BRANCH-1(config)#aaa authentication login LOCAL-DB local[/code] We now have to apply these method lists to the correct lines on the router. The OPEN-CON is going on the console line under \u0026quot;line con 0\u0026quot; below is the command to apply it. [code]BRANCH-1(config)#line console 0 BRANCH-1(config-line)#login authentication OPEN-CON BRANCH-1(config-line)#exit[/code] When I attempt to login the router from the console I don't have to type a password to get into it, except for the enable secret password. [code]BRANCH-1 con0 is now available Press RETURN to get started. BRANCH-1\u0026gt; BRANCH-1\u0026gt;en Password: BRANCH-1#[/code] Now let's apply the last method list we have created called LOCAL-DB which will check the local database for a valid username and password before granting access we will apply this to the VTY lines 0 through 4 below is the command to apply it. [code]BRANCH-1(config)#line vty 0 4 BRANCH-1(config-line)#login authentication LOCAL-DB BRANCH-1(config-line)#exit[/code] When I attempt to login the from a telnet session I get prompted to type a username and password before get access to the router. If SSH was enabled on this device I would be prompted the same thing. To review we have we went over creating AAA locally on our router or switch, we talked about using the just the default method list and we also covered created our own method lists to which we applied to the console and VTY lines. Since each were using a different method list, different login results happened. On the console we were presented with no username and password and just the enable secret password. When we attempted to login into the one of the VTY lines by using telnet and or SSH we were required to type a username and password before gaining entry to the router or switch.

You will notice some old references no longer mentioned on this refresh, so let's go over the differences and some of the changes Cisco has made to the associate-level certification track. Starting at the CCNA the refreshed exams are the following, 100-101 ICND1 (which replaces 640-822 exam), 200-101 ICND2 (which replaces 640-816 exam), and the all in wonder 200-120 CCNA (which replaces the all in wonder 640-802 exam). Like I mentioned earlier the last day to take these older exams are September 30th of 2013 so good luck :) What has changed:\nThe certification was formerly called CCNA is now called CCNA Routing and Switching with no prerequisites (Like before) If you wish to have advanced technology certifications like the CCNA Security, CCNA Voice, CCNA Wireless you must have at least a CCENT or CCNA R\u0026amp;S (Before you had to have CCNA) Expect these exams to have Router IOS version 15 instead of versions 12.4, expect more IPv6 information as IPv4 is depleted , and IOS licensing. No RIP version 1 or version 2 :( No WLAN information Some of the information that was in the ICND2 has shifted to the new ICND1 100-101. You can find more information at Cisco's Newsroom, along with going to Cisco's Training \u0026amp; Certifications site and looking at the Associate Certifications area. What do you think of these changes? If you studying for the older exam don't worry and continue going for it and get it done before September 30th of 2013!

In this introduction we will introduce CCP and setup a community and then finally discover our devices within CCP. This is not the first GUI tool Cisco has produced to manage individual routers, an older tool called Cisco SDM also helped Network Administrators which supports the ISR Generation 1 routers. In this blog a while back I talked about Cisco SDM and walked through some tutorials on using it. Although it's reaching age with Cisco support it is still officially supported until February 28th 2014. The good news with CCP is it supports these older ISR Generation 1 routers as well as the new ISR Generation 2 routers, were Cisco SDM only support ISR G1 routers. In this tutorial I am using CCP version 2.6 and to get your hands on CCP all you need is a login into Cisco (which is free), your account does not need to have any current support contracts tied to it, just be sure to download the 160MB file and install it on a PC that has access to the supported Cisco routers. The system requirements to run CCP is to have Java installed and Adobe Flash player along with at least 1GB of RAM (it won't let you install it if you have less). NOTE: I have had the hardest time getting this working on Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 9 so I bailed and went to running Windows XP SP3 with Internet Explorer 8. Let me know if you can get it working with Windows 7, according to Cisco it's supported, here the Release Notes for Cisco Configuration Professional 2.6 to prove it. UPDATE: Thanks to Kevin and his suggestion I was able to get CCP working with Windows 7 and Windows Vista using Internet Explorer 9. In either Windows 7 and Windows Vista, Right-Click on the CCP icon and select Run as Administrator (An easy fix) :) After CCP is installed you'll need a router, or if you just want to see what it looks like you can demo this program. When you demo this program not all features will be enabled, but it does get you familiar with the CCP interface. When you first open CCP you will be presented a screen to manage your community. A community is a group of routers that may or may not share something in common. This could be that all routers in community called group A are physically at building A, or you could use the hierarchical model and have a community for all core routers but then a separate community for all branch routers. Or you could have all of your routers in one community in the end the design of how to organize it is up to you. A CCP Community can have up to ten routers in one community, so if you have more ten routers you will have to use at least two different communities. In this example you can see I have three routers all in one community called Acme Corporation. If you noticed on the Manage Community page there is an option to connect securely, this is recommend if this is in a production environment as it protects the username and password with SSH and HTTPS. In this example I selected the check box Discover all devices which is towards the bottom of the Manage Community page, CCP would attempt to login into each router with the username and password I provided and read its current running-configuration. You could also discover each device manually if you did not want to discover all routers in the community by just selecting the router's IP address and choosing the option Discover. I would say that's a good introduction into CCP. I would go ahead and download the program and get comfortable with it. Because it is an area the CCNA Security exam is likely to test on. CCP has a lot of features to it and we only started at the basics for getting the program running and discovering our devices. Check back often as I would like to go through some of the wizards within CCP as well as some of the advanced functionally that is available with CCP, you don't always have to go command-line commando and I would consider CCP a good program to use for your technical toolbox. Like always I hope this information is helpful. :)\nRelated articles Cisco Most renowned certification IT Certifications (itmashable.com) Get Hands-On Practice With GNS3 (datacenterknowledge.com) Cisco and Zenoss Make Collaboration Look Good (zenoss.com) Comments: CCNA Version 2.0 Refresh | Cisco Skills - Mar 4, 2013\n[...] ← Previous [...]\n#### [Configuring AAA – Locally | Cisco Skills](http://ciscoskills.net/2013/04/03/configuring-aaa-locally/ \"\") - Apr 3, 2013\r[...] Introduction into Cisco Configuration Professional (ciscoskills.net) [...]\n#### [Kevin]( \"aslan777gfa@gmail.com\") - Mar 0, 2013\rRyan, this from the cisco security lab manual: Note: If the PC is running Windows 7, it may be necessary to right-click on the Cisco CP icon or menu item, and choose Run as administrator.

Well if your Cisco router or switch has Cisco IOS 12.3T and higher you would be able to set up an auto archive within the flash memory of the unit or you can send that configuration file to a server that does either FTP, HTTP, SCP. TFTP, etc. Let's work through on setting up the archive feature on a Cisco Router. In this example we will look at one way to archive your configuration to the flash memory of the unit. This is good if you want the ability to revert back quickly to an existing configuration that has been saved in flash. Keep in mind this is not the only way to archive your configuration, instead of archiving it to flash memory you could back it up on a server using some common transfer file protocol like FTP, TFTP and other options. Let's start setting up the archive feature so I'm on the HQ Router and to archive to flash, the first thing we have to do is enter configuration mode followed by typing archive and hit enter. [code]HQ#configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. HQ(config)#archive HQ(config-archive)#[/code] You will notice we are in the archive configuration mode hit the question to see the available commands. [code]HQ(config-archive)#? Archive configuration commands: default Set a command to its defaults exit Exit from archive configuration mode log Logging commands maximum maximum number of backup copies no Negate a command or set its defaults path path for backups rollback Rollback parameters time-period Period of time in minutes to automatically archive the running-config write-memory Enable automatic backup generation during write memory[/code] For this we will put are configuration on the flash file system let's keep it simple by just calling it HQ-RTR.config here is our example: [code]HQ(config-archive)#path flash:HQ-RTR.config[/code] This writes the configuration into flash and by default writes up to ten and then rolls them over. This is also where you could point this path to an FTP/TFTP server instead of flash. To archive your configuration while under the config-archive mode you have two choices, both of these options could be used together. The write-memory option will archive you configuration after you issue the copy running-config startup-config command. The time-period command will write the configuration to flash every X amount minutes. Where X is the number of minutes you specify after the command. See an example of both commands below: [code]HQ(config-archive)#write-memory HQ(config-archive)#time-period 500000[/code] To see your archives you can issue the command show archive, in this example I have two archives located in flash. This command would also work if you are storing them on a FTP/TFTP server. [code]HQ#show archive There are currently 3 archive configurations saved. The next archive file will be named flash:HQ-RTR.config-3 Archive # Name 0 1 flash:HQ-RTR.config-1 2 flash:HQ-RTR.config-2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14[/code] You can also see these archives in the flash file system by issuing the show flash command. [code]HQ#show flash: -#- --length-- -----date/time------ path 1 19939672 Sep 16 2008 15:51:54 +00:00 c1841-spservicesk9-mz.124-6.T7.bin 2 1122 Jan 22 2013 03:49:18 +00:00 HQ-RTR.config-1 3 1142 Jan 22 2013 03:54:28 +00:00 HQ-RTR.config-2 44060672 bytes available (19951616 bytes used)[/code] Let's roll back from an archive, to do this it is pretty simple just use the configure replace command followed by archive and the archive file you would like to replace the running-config. Let's look below and see the process as an example. [code]HQ#configure replace archive:flash:HQ-RTR.config-2 This will apply all necessary additions and deletions to replace the current running configuration with the contents of the specified configuration file, which is assumed to be a complete configuration, not a partial configuration. Enter Y if you are sure you want to proceed. ? [no]: Y HQ#[/code] That's it! You can either put these archives on the flash of the device or you can setup a simple FTP, TFTP, SCP, etc. box and have your configurations stored there. Like always I hope this information is helpful and post below if you have questions about this topic.You can also find more information on Cisco's website about the archiving along with the configure replace and rollback commands. Configuration Replace and Configuration Rollback Enjoy! :)\nRelated articles Configure DHCP on a Cisco Router (ciscoskills.net) How to Remove Tracked Interface from HSRP (rekrowten.wordpress.com) SFTP/FTP Password Exposure via sftp-config.json (sucuri.net) ","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2013/01/22/archive-your-configuration/","section":"post","tags":["Archive","CCNA","Cisco","Cisco IOS","cisco router","Configuration file","File Transfer Protocol","FTP","networking","router","technology","Tutorials"],"title":"Archive your Configuration"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco-router/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"cisco router"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/file-transfer-protocol/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"File Transfer Protocol"},{"body":" Data-connect-computer In this short tutorial let's configure a DHCP server on a Cisco Router. Why would we want to do that? Well configuring a basic DHCP server on a router is a good idea if this is a branch/satellite office or just a small business. There are some pros and cons of configuring DHCP on a Cisco Router so let's briefly discuss them and then start configuring. Putting DHCP on a router is pretty easy and that's one advantage of setting up DHCP no need to setup a Linux or Windows server. However this also depends on what type of environment you are running, if the company has an Active Directory structure that can be a showstopper if you want have DHCP on the router. There can be a problems because while your domain controller controls DNS any PC that gets an address from DHCP that the router is handing out may not be updated in DNS. (Active Directory likes to have DNS that is current) There have been issues with Active Directory and the best solution is to setup the DHCP service on the Windows server and disable DHCP on the router. That way both DNS and DHCP is automatically added/updated when a new PC joins the network. Along with way more functionality on the server side than the router side, like such as clustering and or load balancing DHCP servers if there is ever need. Although Cisco routers are great it's not designed for a clustering load balancing DHCP server. A router's main job is forwarding and routing data and although routers can have more than one job besides routing this also adds more load to the router if it already has big shoes to fill. ;) So now let's begin learning how to configure DHCP, listed below is the current running-config on the router called Branch-1 in which we will configure DHCP on. [code]BRANCH-1#show run Building configuration... Current configuration : 1075 bytes ! version 12.3 service timestamps debug datetime msec service timestamps log datetime msec no service password-encryption ! hostname BRANCH-1 ! boot-start-marker boot-end-marker ! ! no network-clock-participate aim 0 no network-clock-participate aim 1 no aaa new-model ip subnet-zero ! ! ip cef ! ! ip ips po max-events 100 no ftp-server write-enable ! ! ! interface FastEthernet0/0 ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0 duplex auto speed auto ! interface FastEthernet0/1 no ip address shutdown duplex auto speed auto ! ! ip classless no ip http server no ip http secure-server ! ! ! ! control-plane ! ! line con 0 logging synchronous line aux 0 line vty 0 4 login ! scheduler allocate 20000 1000 ! end [/code] This configuration is pretty basic and if PCs where connected to FastEthernet 0/0 they would be able to ping the gateway if they where manually setup with the correct IP addresses. This maybe be ok if you only had a couple of PCs to work with but even then it is pretty simple to set up a DHCP server instead of manually configuring PCs so let's start configuring it!\nFor this example we are going to be configuring a DHCP pool called DHCP-40-POOL. We are also going to be excluding address from this pool which will be 192.168.40.0 - 192.168.40.5 In this example we don't have an internal DNS server so we will be using one of OpenDNS's servers. That IP address is 208.67.222.222. We will also configure a secondary DNS server, that IP address is 8.8.8.8 (Thanks Google) Finally are domain name for this example will be BRANCH1.CISCOSKILLS.NET Let's get connected to Branch-1 and verify you are in global configuration mode and type the following to create a DHCP pool. (This example is using DHCP-40-POOL) [code]BRANCH-1(config)#ip dhcp pool DHCP-40-POOL BRANCH-1(dhcp-config)#[/code] You'll notice that we are now in the DHCP-Config area. If you type a question mark we will see the available options we can configure while under this mode. [code]BRANCH-1(dhcp-config)#? DHCP pool configuration commands: accounting Send Accounting Start/Stop messages bootfile Boot file name class Specify a DHCP class client-identifier Client identifier client-name Client name default-router Default routers dns-server DNS servers domain-name Domain name exit Exit from DHCP pool configuration mode hardware-address Client hardware address host Client IP address and mask import Programatically importing DHCP option parameters lease Address lease time netbios-name-server NetBIOS (WINS) name servers netbios-node-type NetBIOS node type network Network number and mask next-server Next server in boot process no Negate a command or set its defaults option Raw DHCP options origin Configure the origin of the pool subnet Subnet allocation commands update Dynamic updates utilization Configure various utilization parameters vrf Associate this pool with a VRF [/code] So for this example we first need to type the network that will be using DHCP. (For this tutorial it's the 192.168.40.0 network so the command would look something like this: [code]BRANCH-1(dhcp-config)#network 192.168.40.0 255.255.255.0[/code] To set the default router for DHCP (This is usually the router's interface address, PCs would call this their default gateway.) [code]BRANCH-1(dhcp-config)#default-router 192.168.40.1[/code] To set the domain name of this network (This example is using BRANCH1.CISCOSKILLS.NET) [code]BRANCH-1(dhcp-config)#domain-name BRANCH1.CISCOSKILLS.NET[/code] To set DNS servers (You can type more than one in this example I have two DNS servers 208.67.222.222 is the first DNS server followed by 8.8.8.8) [code]BRANCH-1(dhcp-config)#dns-server 208.67.222.222 8.8.8.8[/code] Our last setup is to exclude some address for this example we are going to excluding the first five address in the the 192.168.40.0/24 range. We have to exit out of the DHCP-config mode and go back to the global configuration mode: [code]BRANCH-1(dhcp-config)#exit BRANCH-1(config)#ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.40.0 192.168.40.5[/code] Let's do a copy run start to save changes and if we now look at the running-config to verify our DHCP settings it should look something like the example below. [code]BRANCH-1#copy run startup-config Destination filename [startup-config]? Building configuration... [OK] BRANCH-1#show run Building configuration... Current configuration : 1083 bytes ! version 12.3 service timestamps debug datetime msec service timestamps log datetime msec no service password-encryption ! hostname BRANCH-1 ! -- OMITITED-- ! ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.40.0 192.168.40.5 ! ip dhcp pool DHCP-40-POOL network 192.168.40.0 255.255.255.0 dns-server 208.67.222.222 8.8.8.8 default-router 192.168.40.1 domain-name BRANCH1.CISCOSKILLS.NET ! -- OMITITED--[/code] We should now have DHCP running on our router, if we look at a PC in command prompt and issue the ipconfig /all command all the settings we configured on the router are passing to the PC. Here is some output of the PC that is connected to Branch-1. [code]C:\\Windows\\system32\u0026gt;ipconfig /all -- OMITITED-- IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.40.6(Preferred) Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0 Lease Obtained. . . . . . . . . . : Sunday, November 25, 2012 11:13:58 AM Lease Expires . . . . . . . . . . : Monday, November 26, 2012 11:13:57 AM Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.40.1 DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.40.1 DHCPv6 IAID . . . . . . . . . . . : 234884137 DHCPv6 Client DUID. . . . . . . . : 00-01-00-01-18-21-0E-A6-00-0C-29-22-D2-2 DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 208.67.222.222 8.8.8.8 NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled -- OMITITED--[/code] That's it! I hope this tutorial was helpful, to review we just configured a DHCP server on a Cisco IOS Router! As mentioned there are pros and cons when setting up DHCP on a router instead of a Windows or Linux server and the overall configuration in setting up DHCP is simple. If you noticed there are commands available while in the DHCP mode that we have not even touched and I would encourage you to either search them on the web or try them out in a lab environment.

Like the name suggests this exam focuses on the Data Center and if passed you can continue up the stack by also taking the CCNP Data Center exam which was also recently introduced as well. Still want more a little more, if you are up for the challenge you can also tackle the CCIE Data Center which is an exam that was introduced in March of 2012.\nLooking at the CCNA DC certification requirements, there is no need to get certificated in the regular CCNA Routing and Switching as it is not required but looking at the renewal options for this certification you have to either get a CCNA concentration exam like CCNA Wireless, Security, Voice, SP, SP Ops or a higher certification like CCNP and above.\nAn interesting thing I noticed when looking at Cisco's Career Certifications is that if you passed your CCNA Data Center exam and then later you passed the regular CCNA exam the CCNA Data Center certification would not renew. Unlike if you recived your CCNP Data Center certification and then took the CCNP exam it would renew you CCNP Data Center certification. What makes this exam so different from the rest of Cisco's certifications? Well to what I can tell this exam focuses on a specific area, meaning you don't need to have any certifications to back you up before you take the CCNA Data Center exam, and you can continue with CCNP Data Center exam without the need to have any other certifications beside CCNA DC. To pass the CCNA Data Center and receive your certification, you will need to pass two exams. The first exam (640-911 DCICN) looks at how a Data Center network works, along with configuring, verifying and troubleshooting data center switches.\nThis exam also looks at implementing data center IP address schemes and configuring, along with verifying and troubleshooting routing on Nexus switches. The second exam (640-916 DCICT) looks at Cisco's Unified Computing System, and virtualization by talking about the fundamentals. Along with focusing on the data center storage switching and the unified fabric between them. Finally this exam looks at the Data Center Network Services, like such as Cisco ACS and load balancing between servers and management options.\nExcited? You can find more information by going to CCNA Data Center - Career Certifications and check out the The Cisco Learning Network and the section CCNA Data Center. Because of this recent announcement there are limited if any Cisco Press books out there, (Let me know if you find one ;) ) but I'm sure that will change within a couple months. Check back to this post to see any updates on reading material as I will be actively looking.\nUPDATE: There is a book available from Todd Lammle - CCNA Data Center - Introducing Cisco Data Center Networking Study Guide This title looks like it only covers the 640-911 exam. **UPDATE 2: **Since Cisco has now re-amped the ICND1 (ICND1 100-101) and ICND2 (ICND2 200-101) you can now get the CCNA Data Center cert renewed by passing the any current Associate-level exam except for the ICND1. :)\nRelated articles Next Generations Data Centers Need Next Generation Skills (blogs.cisco.com) Cisco Overhauls Data Center Certifications (thevarguy.com) VMware Certification for Cisco People (networkingnerd.net) Static Comments: Passed 640-554! « Cisco Skills - Jun 6, 2013\n[…] what is my next plan?

It talked about the \u0026quot;forces\u0026quot; of a new network framework and in this post I'll focus on the business forces that make a new framework necessary. I find it interesting when looking at companies because although customer service is important to sustain a company, I also think it will and may already have depend on who embraces the technology wheel, those that do will ultimately win. There's a catch, just because you have a nice low-riding sports car you wouldn't want to drive it on a rocky dirt road would you? That's same thing with some big applications and services running on a network. You don't want the network to be your own enemy and unfortunately that usually is the last thing people look at. If a company is serious about their goals there are several things a company will look at to improve their business. Having a strong infrastructure to be able to handle the CEO's wrath is good, but this infrastructure has to handle the competition and any new services and applications the organization decides to throw at it. You are only as strong as your weakness link, so the network is especially important because it's the means of communication with application data, voice, and video. If the network is unavailable so is your applications and services and ultimately your company. There are usually three key areas an organization will look at before moving forward on purchasing an upgraded/new network infrastructure, and usually any other services and products as well:\nReturn on Investment is a big one and most companies and most won't go ahead until they can see money down this path instead of nothing. What's in it for me? How will this improve our business? How will this make money instead of draining it? Regulation is another big one, Why would a company change anything if there already on the top? Sometimes Uncle Sam has to come along and must companies to be compliant, or they are fined and may even be shutdown. (This adds the twist in the game but this usually helps out the common folk like you and me in the end :) Being competitive; You can't beat a company if you are doing the exact some thing as your competitor. Being faster, smarter, and changing your techniques often with the competition will make you different from the rest and may even give you some extra steps forward from everybody else. In the end it all comes down the cost and this cost is investment it's not something lost forever, if done correctly this investment would pay off. Although we may not see it physically you will see an increase in how much scalability the company can handle, the availability of products and services, the performance of application and services and the overall efficiency of whole network infrastructure. It's simple fact, less downtime equals more productivity and in the end equals money for the company. There is always a balance however, you could argue less downtime equals the more money you have to spend to keep it up and running. That's where the balance begins, does it take more money then what the company can produce to keep the systems up 99.99 percent of the time? Is it worth to drop it to 95 percent up-time to save a couple of thousands or are you now loosing more money than you are saving? These are all questions where everyone has to come to the table and discuss, because it is no longer just an IT problem its an organization problem. The business force for the network is important but there are others, check back to see what technology-related forces exist with the network framework.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2012/10/30/the-network-and-its-forces/","section":"post","tags":["Business Services","CCDA","Cisco","Cloud Computing","Computer network","Customer service","Data Communications","General","Infrastructure","Installation","Network","networking","technology","Telecommunications"],"title":"The Network and its Forces"},{"body":" A Cisco Lab When it comes to learning and getting started with Cisco there are some tools that will help out a lot like Packet Tracer, GNS3 and other emulators. These are great tools for that \u0026quot;simulation\u0026quot; of hands on learning, but you can't always stay in that area. I find it best to get hands on with \u0026quot;real\u0026quot; Cisco Gear and so with this post I'll go through my current setup of what I have and ask that question when it is a good time to get a lab? Just because you may want to get a lab that does not guarantee you'll actually learn and or pass. I'll cut right to it and break it down; I have the following items:\n1 x Tripp Lite SRW9U 9U Wall Mount Rack 2 x Cisco 2811 Routers with IOS Security 1x Cisco 1841 Router with IOS SP Services 1 x Cisco Catalyst 2960 Switch 48 ports (LAN Base) 1 x Cisco ASA 5505 – Base 1 x Cisco AS2509-RJ – Used as an access server All of these devices are connected via a console cable to the Cisco 2509 and then a single console cable from the 2509 to my machine. This runs VMware Workstation 9 which I just upgraded by the way :) and these virtual machines connect directly to one of the three NICs I have on my machine. These then connect to a Cisco Switch which has four different VLANs (counting the default native VLAN) each assigned to a different range of ports which is seen in the code below: [code]Switch#show vlan VLAN Name Status Ports ---- -------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------- 1 default active Fa0/37, Fa0/38, Fa0/39, Fa0/40 Fa0/41, Fa0/42, Fa0/43, Fa0/44 Fa0/45, Fa0/46, Fa0/47, Fa0/48 Gi0/1, Gi0/2 20 ONE-12 active Fa0/1, Fa0/2, Fa0/3, Fa0/4 Fa0/5, Fa0/6, Fa0/7, Fa0/8 Fa0/9, Fa0/10, Fa0/11, Fa0/12 30 12-24 active Fa0/13, Fa0/14, Fa0/15, Fa0/16 Fa0/17, Fa0/18, Fa0/19, Fa0/20 Fa0/21, Fa0/22, Fa0/23, Fa0/24 40 25-36 active Fa0/25, Fa0/26, Fa0/27, Fa0/28 Fa0/29, Fa0/30, Fa0/31, Fa0/32 Fa0/33, Fa0/34, Fa0/35, Fa0/36 1002 fddi-default act/unsup 1003 token-ring-default act/unsup 1004 fddinet-default act/unsup 1005 trnet-default act/unsup VLAN Type SAID MTU Parent RingNo BridgeNo Stp BrdgMode Trans1 Trans2 ---- ----- ---------- ----- ------ ------ -------- ---- -------- ------ ------ VLAN Type SAID MTU Parent RingNo BridgeNo Stp BrdgMode Trans1 Trans2 ---- ----- ---------- ----- ------ ------ -------- ---- -------- ------ ------ 1 enet 100001 1500 - - - - - 0 0 20 enet 100020 1500 - - - - - 0 0 30 enet 100030 1500 - - - - - 0 0 40 enet 100040 1500 - - - - - 0 0 1002 fddi 101002 1500 - - - - - 0 0 1003 tr 101003 1500 - - - - - 0 0 1004 fdnet 101004 1500 - - - ieee - 0 0 1005 trnet 101005 1500 - - - ibm - 0 0 Remote SPAN VLANs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Primary Secondary Type Ports ------- --------- ----------------- ------------------------------------------ Switch#[/code] The three NICs on my machine that I use for VMs are not useable to my machine locally. As I have disabled IPv4 and only left the VMware Bridge Protocol selected under the adapter properties, from there I have also edited the VMware Virtual Network Editor as follows and pictured below:\nVMnet1 – Is bridged to my motherboard NIC and directly connected to a VM VMnet2 – Is bridged to an Intel Gigabit PCI express card and directly connected to VM VMnet3 – Is bridged to an Intel Gigabit PCI express card and directly connected to VM Here is a picture of my current setup (The ASA is not in this picture): Cisco Lab Second Picture of the Rack with the door closed: Cisco Lab-2 Here is a screenshot of the one the NICs Properties: NIC-Properties-VMWare Here is a screenshot of the VMware Virtual Network Editor and how each NIC is bridged and directly connected to a VM: VMware-Network-Editor When I want a machine to use a NIC I just select one of the VMnet profiles as captured below: VMware-Virtual-Machine-Settings-Network So I talked about my current lab setup which will always continue to grow and be upgraded in time just like a \u0026quot;real\u0026quot; environment but there is another question when do you need lab? I would only setup a lab on at least one of these three conditions:\nYou have money to burn. This lab although small cost around $1,000 bucks. You see yourself going to higher certification levels CCNA Security, Wireless, Voice, CCNP, CCIE and not just the CCNA. You absolutely love this stuff! For me it was option three that sold me, not only do I see myself working to higher certs but having that physical gear in hand is always the best type of learning (I think). When you go through your studies instead of just believing the answer, prove it by setting up the example physically instead of a point and click setup through simulation/emulation. I hope this information is helpful and if you have any questions about my lab and or other questions comment below.\nRelated articles The Next Evolution of Cisco's Nexus 1000V Virtual Switch to be Featured at VMworld (blogs.cisco.com) The Good, The Great, and the Gotcha with Multi-NIC vMotion in vSphere 5 (longwhiteclouds.com) Going beyond CloudStack Advanced Networking: How I replaced the Virtual Router with my own physical Linux router (remibergsma.com) Cisco CVD's on VSPEX...Giddy 'UP!

In February 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigned the last /8 address blocks to the Regional Internet Registries so time is getting close but you have heard this warning before right? Let's go over IPv6 at least just an overview some the features and changes compared to IPv4 because one day it will happen it's just a matter of when. :) So the first thing to understand about IPv6 is that it's a 128-bit binary value, which is displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits. What does this mean in the size or scope of the addresses?\nWell it has been suggested that if you were to give everyone in the world the entire IPv4 scope (4,294,267,295 addresses), you still would have more than enough IPv6 address! You could give everyone on the planet trillions of IPv6 addresses and still have leftovers! There are many enhancements that IPv6 offers compared to IPv4 like such as:\nEnhanced IP addressing – Improved global reachability and flexibility along with better IP prefixes announced in routing tables. Say goodbye to broadcasts because there's none in IPv6 and no threat of broadcast storms. Multi-homed hosts a technique to increase reliability of the internet, because each host can have multiple IP addresses with one physical link. This makes it easier to have this host be connected to different ISP at the same time. Let's compare the IPv4 header with IPV6. There less junk in the IPv6 header and because of that less overhead when compared to IPv4, we have better routing within the network and no checksums.\nAs you can see the IPv6 header looks simpler and although it is 40 octets compared to the IPv4 header which is 20 octets. IPv6 has to have IPsec which is a mandatory part for IPv6 unlike IPv4 which is an option. (Security, Security, Security)\nSince IPv6 and IPv4 don't work together directly how can we ever switch over? There are transition solutions like Dual Stacking, 6to4 tunneling and NAT-PT, ISATAP tunneling and Teredo tunneling.\nDual Stacking – is a method of basically running both IPv4 and IPv6 in the network environment and using IPv6 as the preferred protocol. 6to4 tunneling – which automatically establishes connections to IPv6 networks through IPv4 network, like the internet. It applies a valid IPv6 prefix to each \u0026quot;island\u0026quot; thus enables a fast deployment of IPv6 in corporate without having the ISP to be involved. Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) tunneling - which is another tunneling option which uses the IPv4 network as the link layer of IPv6. Teredo Tunneling – this provides host-to-host automatic tunneling instead of relying on the gateway. This passes IPv6 traffic when dual-stacked hosts (Systems that are running IPv4 and IPv6 are located behind one or multiple IPv4 NATs. (By default this is already running on Windows Vista and Windows 7 if you do the command \u0026quot;ipconfig\u0026quot; in command you'll see it) IPv6 is not new and some countries already have it in place. We the United States just wanted to delay it because no body likes to change, but the awesome part about this is to the average user nobody should know and the internet lives on. That's really the rundown of IPv6 of course there's more but for an overview of IPv6 it is not a bad start. I hope this information is helpful and if you have questions let's see if I can answer them or if anybody else can.\nRelated articles IPv6 Peering, Part 2: The Next Steps for ISP Interfacing (blogs.cisco.com) IPv6 Subnetting - The Paradigm Shift (circleid.com) How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love IPv6 (go.theregister.com) ","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2012/08/22/why-ipv6/","section":"post","tags":["CCNA","Internet Assigned Numbers Authority","IP address","ipv4","ipv6","ISATAP","Network","networking","Regional Internet registry","technology"],"title":"Why IPv6?"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/command-line-interface/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Command-line interface"},{"body":" Secure In this post I want to cover how to recover passwords on a Cisco IOS Router. This is helpful in lab environments as well as production environments. Although this method can be used the correct \u0026quot;legal\u0026quot; way you can also use this method to break into these devices \u0026quot;illegally\u0026quot; if you have physical console access to the device. However to get into it physical power must be turned off first causing a disruption in the environment, let get started! So I have a router called R2-D2 at ACME Corp, I have been given permission to recover the password and access the device. I have tried some passwords that where written down but all failed.

Immediately I have to press the \u0026quot;break sequence\u0026quot; (which depends on the terminal application you are using. In TeraTerm this sequence is ALT + B) I like to think of this as a BIOS like on a computer, but it is normally called ROMon in Cisco terms or ROM Monitor, notice the prompt? At this prompt you have to type \u0026quot;confreg 0x2142\u0026quot; which ignores or bypass the startup-config file. Then type the command \u0026quot;reset\u0026quot; to reload the router which will bypass the statup-config.

This is a pretty painless method if all goes well the only thing you have to do schedule downtime if this box is in production, and grab the ASA IOS image from Cisco. For this post all have been covered let's get started! First things first is always backup your configuration before upgrading and I always read the release notes that Cisco provides when I download the IOS image, it's good reading and important because usually new features are introduced and sometime the ASDM can't paraphrase and parse the new configuration which way I usually upgrade the ASDM first. There are couple ways of backing the configuration this example is with the ASDM. In this example open up the ASDM client and go to file and select \u0026quot;Show Running Configuration in New Window\u0026quot; this will open up the current running-config in a browser window and from there you can either save the page or copy it to a text editor. ASDM-Run-Config Once the configuration is saved you are ready to go for the upgrade. Select \u0026quot;Tools\u0026quot; and you have two options. If this ASA can go online you can select the first option (Check for ASA/ASDM Updates) which will ask for your Cisco account that is tied with SmartNet, which downloads the IOS or ASDM or both images automatically and installs them with very little effort on your part. For this post we have to one more extra setup to install this IOS we'll select the \u0026quot;Upgrade Software from Local Computer\u0026quot; ASDM-Tools A window comes select what image you are uploading the to the ASA, notice this is also the same method of installing/upgrading the ASDM along with helpful tools like the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client. This example we selected the ASA image and have browsed our local computer to the ASA image that we downloaded from Cisco our next move is to uploading the image. ASDM-Upload-IOS uploading Finally another window will show letting you know that the image is setup and goes through the process of telling you how to reload the ASA. Also it reminds you to make sure the ASDM version will work with this new IOS image which would be in the release notes Cisco puts out, from there reload the ASA. Once the ASA reboots open up the ASDM and you'll notice that we now have the ASA version of 8.4(3)!\nASA-uploaded ASA-version Keeping up with versions of the ASA is important but you have to weigh the risks of updating, take this upgrade for example from 8.2 to 8.4 a lot of configurations have changed which is why it is really important to look at the release notes. I hope this information is helpful and if you have any questions or comments let me know.\nRelated articles Basic Cisco ASA Overview (ciscoskills.net) CCNA Security - 640-554 (ciscoskills.net) Auto Backup Cisco router/switch using Kron and vsftpd FTP.

These ASA's can be used as a standalone appliance' that can handle the need for branch offices to enterprise data centers. Or they can be included in high-performance blades that work together with the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series, and recently new they can also run in a virtual instance which provides tenant isolation for public and private clouds! For now let's focus on the basics of the ASA like the ASDM. The ASDM is a pretty good GUI tool that helps make the ASA a simpler process of maintaining and configuring the device, instead of doing CLI commando style. In this example I have an ASA 5505 with default configuration (I did a \u0026quot;write erase\u0026quot; to clear the IP addressing and DHCP settings) when you reload the device I decided to use the ASA's pre-configure wizard which really just makes the ASA useable by giving the inside interface an IP address along with the correct time and the \u0026quot;enable password\u0026quot; Here are the current settings: [code]The following configuration will be used: Enable password: cisco Allow password recovery: yes Clock (UTC): 11:04:11 Jun 23 2012 Firewall Mode: Routed Inside IP address: 192.168.5.1 Inside network mask: 255.255.255.0 Host name: ASA Domain name: ciscoskills.net IP address of host running Device Manager: 192.168.5.10 Use this configuration and write to flash? yes INFO: Security level for \u0026quot;inside\u0026quot; set to 100 by default.

ASA\u0026gt;en ASA#config t ASA(config)#http server enable[/code] Notice to use the ASDM you must put it one more command for the ASA to listen on port 443 which is \u0026quot;http server enable\u0026quot; from that open up your browser and type the IP address of the ASA in this example it is \u0026quot;192.168.5.1\u0026quot; you can either run the ASDM from the ASA or install it on your system for a faster experience it's your choice, but it does add additional memory and CPU if the ASDM runs on the ASA. ASDM-BROWSER For this example I installed the ASDM on my system and by default the username is blank and the password is \u0026quot;cisco\u0026quot; which is what I configured in the beginning. ASDM-LOGIN From there opens up the ASDM the home page displays some device information like the hostname, ASA version and ASADM version, the runtime, total RAM and flash. It also gives you some traffic stats along with CPU and memory from there to configure the device you would click the configuration button and configure a way! ASDM-HOME You have to have some hands-on experience with this product to really understand it and get the overall feeling of where things in the ASDM. Cisco does offer some ASDM demos that can be searchable on the internet and you can download directly from Cisco however you must have a Cisco ID to use it. If you download this link it will install the latest (May 2012) ASDM demo settings so you can at least get a feeling of the ASDM. I hope this information is helpful and if you have any questions are comments be sure to post them below, also check back often I'll see if I can post some additional content about the ASA like upgrading the ASA IOS version with the ASDM. :)\nRelated articles CCNA Security - 640-554 (ciscoskills.net) Cisco Patches Vulnerabilities in VPN Client, Security Appliances (pcworld.com) New Cisco ASA Step-by-Step Guide Simplifies Configuration (prweb.com) Comments: Upgrade ASA IOS via ASDM | Cisco Skills - Jun 4, 2012\n[...] Post navigation ← Previous [...]\n#### [Password Recovery – Cisco IOS Routers | Cisco Skills](http://ciscoskills.net/2012/07/21/password-recovery-cisco-ios-routers/ \"\") - Jul 6, 2012\r[...] Basic Cisco ASA Overview (ciscoskills.net) [...]\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2012/06/24/basic-cisco-asa-overview/","section":"post","tags":["ASA","ASDM","CCNA Security","Cisco","cisco","Cisco ASA","Cisco Systems","Command-line interface","firewall","General","networking","security","security appliances","Tutorials","Virtual private network"],"title":"Basic Cisco ASA Overview"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/security-appliances/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"security appliances"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/640-554/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"640-554"},{"body":" network-security-lock Out with the old and in with new Cisco is updating its well-known certification CCNA Security.

For the most part Cisco SDM is no longer available instead it is the Cisco Configuration Professional along with that the new exam mentions the Cisco ASA system and walking you into the ASDM along with the different products and services the ASA system offers.\nCCNA Security Exam Topics – (640-553) Describe the security threats facing modern network infrastructures\nDescribe and list mitigation methods for common network attacks\nDescribe and list mitigation methods for Worm, Virus, and Trojan Horse attacks\nDescribe the Cisco Self Defending Network architecture\nSecure Cisco routers\nSecure Cisco routers using the SDM Security Audit feature\nUse the One-Step Lockdown feature in SDM to secure a Cisco router\nSecure administrative access to Cisco routers by setting strong encrypted passwords, exec timeout, login failure rate and using IOS login enhancements\nSecure administrative access to Cisco routers by configuring multiple privilege levels\nSecure administrative access to Cisco routers by configuring role based CLI\nSecure the Cisco IOS image and configuration file\nImplement AAA on Cisco routers using local router database and external ACS\nExplain the functions and importance of AAA\nDescribe the features of TACACS+ and RADIUS AAA protocols\nConfigure AAA authentication\nConfigure AAA authorization\nConfigure AAA accounting\nMitigate threats to Cisco routers and networks using ACLs\nExplain the functionality of standard, extended, and named IP ACLs used by routers to filter packets\nConfigure and verify IP ACLs to mitigate given threats (filter IP traffic destined for Telnet, SNMP, and DDoS attacks) in a network using CLI\nConfigure IP ACLs to prevent IP address spoofing using CLI\nDiscuss the caveats to be considered when building ACLs\nImplement secure network management and reporting\nUse CLI and SDM to configure SSH on Cisco routers to enable secured management access\nUse CLI and SDM to configure Cisco routers to send Syslog messages to a Syslog server\nMitigate common Layer 2 attacks\nDescribe how to prevent layer 2 attacks by configuring basic Catalyst switch security features Implement the Cisco IOS firewall feature set using SDM\nDescribe the operational strengths and weaknesses of the different firewall technologies\nExplain stateful firewall operations and the function of the state table\nImplement Zone Based Firewall using SDM\nImplement the Cisco IOS IPS feature set using SDM\nDefine network based vs. host based intrusion detection and prevention\nExplain IPS technologies, attack responses, and monitoring options\nEnable and verify Cisco IOS IPS operations using SDM\nImplement site-to-site VPNs on Cisco Routers using SDM\nExplain the different methods used in cryptography\nExplain IKE protocol functionality and phases\nDescribe the building blocks of IPSec and the security functions it provides\nConfigure and verify an IPSec site-to-site VPN with pre-shared key authentication using SDM\nCCNA Security Exam Topics – (640-554) Common Security Threats\nDescribe common security threats Security and Cisco Routers\nImplement security on Cisco routers\nDescribe securing the control, data, and management plane\nDescribe Cisco Security Manager\nDescribe IPv4 to IPv6 transition\nAAA on Cisco Devices\nImplement AAA (authentication, authorization, and accounting)\nDescribe TACACS+\nDescribe RADIUS\nDescribe AAA\nVerify AAA functionality\nIOS ACLs\nDescribe standard, extended, and named IP IOS access control lists (ACLs) to filter packets\nDescribe considerations when building ACLs\nImplement IP ACLs to mitigate threats in a network\nSecure Network Management and Reporting\nDescribe secure network management\nImplement secure network management\nCommon Layer 2 Attacks\nDescribe Layer 2 security using Cisco switches\nDescribe VLAN security\nImplement VLANs and trunking\nImplement spanning tree\nCisco Firewall Technologies\nDescribe operational strengths and weaknesses of the different firewall technologies\nDescribe stateful firewalls\nDescribe the types of NAT used in firewall technologies\nImplement zone-based policy firewall using CCP\nImplement the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)\nImplement Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT)\nCisco IPS\nDescribe Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) deployment considerations\nDescribe IPS technologies\nConfigure Cisco IOS IPS using CCP\nVPN Technologies\nDescribe the different methods used in cryptography\nDescribe VPN technologies\nDescribe the building blocks of IPSec\nImplement an IOS IPSec site-to-site VPN with pre-shared key authentication\nVerify VPN operations\nImplement Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN using ASA device manager\nFor the most part if you have older books and products that cover the 640-553 exam continue studying as you can see when you compare these exams the fundamentals stay the same and if you think you can take it before September 30th go ahead and go for it! For me I want to take the new exam so I'll take it after September 30th. I also have some good tutorials that cover SDM like (Configure Cisco SDM) back a year ago on this blog along with some security topics like AAA an Radius and TACACS+ go ahead search for them! If you are like me and want to get your hands on some books that cover the new exam (640-554) you will have to wait until July 16th for the Official Certification Guide according to Amazon but you can go head and order the CCNA Security Portable Command Guide which released today.

If you read how I passed ICND1 will find that the way I studied for this exam was totally different from studying for the ICND1. When I finished the ICND2 exam I saw my score and I was proud that I passed but I knew I could have done better but I don't think I would've. Why?\nI've had this exam on my chest for over a year and it drag the matierial became boring and started to dry out because of the consent stop and go style of studying. (Don't do THIS!) This type of studying was going on for months until I decided to go with it because I was tired of relearning it. I studied for the upcomming exam about three weeks ago and on average was about eight hours a week. The book I used was CCNA ICND2 640-816 Official Cert Guide by Wendell Odom.\nSo how did I study for the exam - Well I studied alone for this one, unlike my ICND1 exam. (That was 50 percent of the battle) The other half of it was I had this exam on my chest for a long time. I would also read the material over and over. Yet I would not take the test because of other issues that would come up. I finally said that I am going to schedule this test and take it no matter if I am ready or not, or I would just keep delaying it. In the ICND1 post I made last year make sure you know the material, you can't guess at this stuff! You have to know it inside and out. If it is multiple choice I always look at the answers first before reading the question. I looked over the book the night before the exam date and really was asking myself questions that I could see on the exam, like the default AD distance of OSPF is?, Use VLSM to break this network down so it doesn't waste addresses, etc.\nHow long did it take? - I originally started studying for the exam in April of 2011 so it took over a year for me to take this test. Don't let that scare you, I could have probably taken it in 4 months or so but could not find the time, and life in general. However I passed, which shows that if you keep going for it you will get where you want to go.\nTest Date - So when I scheduled the test I also scheduled it on my birthday, not sure why I did maybe I felt lucky :). I felt pretty good when I started the exam but that soon changed for the worse. Let's just say I took the \u0026quot;I'll study what I think I need\u0026quot; approach. Which worked for me but if you are new to this field I would study everything. Although I passed I was nervous because I spent too much time thinking over the questions and simulations and at the end I had 2 minutes to spare when I finished the exam!\nTo close for comfort! Make a discussion and move on don't over think it. Looking back at my post How I passed the ICND1 exam I can still say that you need to fully understand how to set up routers and switches and just a general concept of the idea. I really think one of the main reasons I passed was that I fully understood the concepts which for the most part is in the ICND1 exam. Taking the two-part exam help me because it focused on key areas of what to study. I think my next certification I'm looking at is CCNA Security but I'm not sure yet and I'm taking a break first. :) Like always I hope this information is helpful and If you are going for your CCNA I wish you the best because I love the that feeling when you pass, because you know it was totally worth it!!\nRelated articles So Long To The CCIP (networkingnerd.net) HDLC vs. PPP (ciscoskills.net) Part 2 - The Joys of Subnetttting - VLSM!

What's your question? Ryan\nRyan - Sep 6, 2012\nHey Darwin, To be honest the Cisco Academy is what really got me hooked into this stuff. If you can afford it I would go for it. They provided the equipment, practice exams and labs along with access to Packet Tracer which is an awesome simulation tool that beats getting real equipment in the CCNA level. What is also nice is once you leave the Academy you still have access to it. The difference with me is I waited too long after I finished the Academy to feel comfortable taking the test although I still knew this stuff I needed a review and it helped that I took the Academy. Don’t take too long after you finish the Academy to take the test... I wish you luck :) Ryan\nDarwin Rodriguez (@dar0d) - Sep 6, 2012\nI am in the Cisco Academy right now, CCNA semester 2.

What makes me laugh is that I really think a lot of people over think this stuff, and the fact that I mispelled subnetting! (Really? 4Ts) It's really not the complicated and it should not scare you. Another thing to mention is that usually in the real world you usually have calculators and another pair of eyes to double-check your work unlike the exam you will need to fully understand it if you would like to pass the ICND2 or the CCNA test. So let's get started! On Part 1 of my subnetting post I was spiting up networks into equal parts.\nExample: If I took an original Class C address of 192.168.5.X (Subnet 255.255.255.0) in broke it up into four parts, each part would be equal. I would use a /26 or a 255.255.255.192. Each network would hold 62 hosts and I would have four of them.\n192.168.5.1 – 192.168.5.62 192.168.5.65 – 192.168.5.90 192.168.5.93 – 192.168.5.126 192.168.5.129 – 192.168.5.254 This example is standard subnetting if this loses you go back and check out my post of Part 1. Also check out this subnetting workbook (which is in Part 1) this workbook will help you to continue to practice subnetting, there are easier ways to get the answers but you have to start at the beginning and really have an understanding of it, once you got it you'll find the shortcuts everyone finds different ways to break this down :) -- Part 1 – The Joys of Subnetting! -- Subnetting Workbook --IP-Subnetting-Workbook\nWith VLSM it's basically the same method but a better way to conserve addresses, instead of having equal parts of the Class address why can't we divide it up and different size pieces? Take a look at the picture below one link requires 111 hosts another only needs 25 hosts and the last one needs 50 hosts. With standard subnetting you would not be able to fulfill this goal. However with VLSM you would let's go through the process.\nSo our corporation Acme wants to expand departments to three different buildings instead of one building. These buildings are connected via a WAN Link to each other. We are handed one IP address class which is a class C from Acme's Tier 3 support. No Problem let's break this down.\nIt is always best to take the biggest number of hosts required in this case it is the Finance department which requires 111 hosts. What is the next step? We can't give a whole class C address because we have two other departments so let's divide it into two. The subnet mask would be 255.255.255.128 and or a /25. These two networks would be able to hold 126 hosts.\n192.168.16.1 - 192.168.16.126\n192.168.16.129 – 192.168.16.254\nDoes this look familiar? So far we are just doing standard subnettng, The Finance department will use the first range. What about the second one let's break it down even further! I would then choose the next biggest subnet which is the IT department which requires 50 hosts. So the range we can work with is 192.168.16.129 – 192.168.16.254. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.128 or a /25. This range is too big still because we still have one more department to work with. So let's break this down to a /26.\n192.168.16.129 – 192.168.16.190 192.168.16.193 – 192.168.16.254 So I just took the original /25 and spilt it into two equal pieces which is like the standard subnettng but now that we have different size networks within the same class C network it's now considered VLSM! I also have an address range that can work with for the IT department we will use 192.168.16.129 – 192.168.16.190. The subnet masks of these two IP address ranges are 255.255.255.192. Each network can hold up to 62 hosts.\nWe could give HR the other range and that might be a good \u0026quot;real world\u0026quot; solution because this looks to perfect right? But for the sake of the exam let's continue so we have the following range left to hack and slash: (Subnet mask is 255.255.255.192)\n192.168.16.193 – 192.168.16.254 Let's break this down one more click to a /27 the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.224. These ranges will be able to handle up to 30 hosts:\n192.168.16.193 – 192.168.16.222 192.168.16.225 – 192.168.16.254 For HR let's pick the range 192.168.16.193 – 192.168.16.222 like before the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.224. That's VLSM!!! Not too bad right? What happens to the other range (192.168.16.225 – 192.168.16.254) that's a spare that can be used elsewhere in the environment of Acme Corporation. So let's look at the picture of our ranges and networks:\nFinance Network --111 Hosts Range: (192.168.16.1 – 192.168.16.128) – Subnet Mask 255.255.255.128 Can support up to 126 hosts\nIT Network --50 Hosts Range: (192.168.16.129 -192.168.16.190) – Subnet Mask 255.255.255.192 Can support up to 62 hosts\nHR Network --25 Hosts Range: (192.168.16.193 – 192.168.16.222) – Subnet Mask 255.255.255.224 Can support up to 30 hosts\nI'll let that sink in if you have a question feel free to post it, I or others would be happy to help you out :). Here is another question for you where else would you put IP addresses that the diagram doesn't say? How many would you need if any? How many networks would you have total including the three networks we did? Like always I hope this information is helpful and if you have a question post it, if you have an idea on the next topic post it!!

I remember back when I started to learn subnetting it was confusing and I wanted nothing to do with it. The thing that made me change my mind was after I understood it and how important it is. In the \u0026quot;Cisco world\u0026quot; they don't cover useless topics...right? ;) there is always a reason why they expect you to know this and it's not just for the exams. Subnetting has always had its moments with people and in this blog I'll do my best to show you what I have done to make subnetting an easier experience. Eons ago I talked about \u0026quot;The Wonders of Binary\u0026quot; which talked about how to convert these ones and zeros into decimal value and is another stepping stone into understanding the subnet world.\nLet's introduce the three classes of subnet masks that PCs can use:\nClass A: 1-127 -- Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0 Class B: 128-191 Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 Class C: 192-223 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Do you get it? Let me explain what is going on, back when the internet was young and just started out we had three IP classes you could use. These classes would be handed out depending on the size of the organization. Usually universities would get a Class B address range, big companies like GE received a class A address. The problem with this is it's a waste of addresses when would you ever have 65,534 (Class B) or 16,277,214 (Class A) computers on the same network? Nothing would work! What could I do to break this down into separate networks?\nThat's where subnetting comes into play, if I had class B address range I could break it up into smaller networks, watch and be amazed. Let's say my class B range is 134.50.0.0 – 134.50.255.255 in this range I have one network so I could have 65,534 computers connected to this. We already said this is stupid setup because nothing would be able talk because this network would be over saturated, remember computers are chatty fellows even when you don't use them. But what I could do is break this address into smaller ranges, instead of one big network I could break it into a Class C address. See if you follow this:\n134.50.1.0 – 134.50.1.255 –Subnet 255.255.255.0 134.50.2.0 – 134.50.2.255 – Subnet 255.255.255.0 134.50.3.0 – 134.50.3.255 – Subnet 255.255.255.0 134.50.4.0 – 134.50.5.255 – Subnet 255.255.255.0 … 134.50.255.0 – 134.50.255.255 –Subnet 255.255.255.0 So what did I just do? Just what I said I would do I broke up this network into smaller networks, so how many networks do I have now? Well instead of one big network I now have 256 smaller networks with each network able to handle 254 computers. Real world example is if this was a campus environment each building can have its own network. Building A can have the 134.50.1.0 network, building B can have the 134.50.2.0 network, etc. This makes the network scalable and way easier to manage, and that's the basics of how subnetting works, for now remember you can always take a bigger subnet and break it down into smaller ones. It is a little tricky to take small subnets and expand them but remember it can be done with something called VLSM and if you designed your network scheme correctly :).\nAlso check out this subnetting workbook which will help you to continue to practice subnetting, there are easier ways to get the answers but you have to start at the beginning and really have an understanding of it, once you got it you'll find the shortcuts :cool:.\nIP-Subnetting-Workbook\nI have used this exact one when I was studying subnetting, try it out and if you have questions feel free to post them. Also if you have other ideas of the next topic I should cover that deals with ICND1 or ICND2 let me know.

To get 8 equal networks we need to subnet them down to a /27, each network would be able to hold 30 hosts and you would have 8 of them. /25 gives you two networks (255.255.255.128) /26 gives you four networks (255.255.255.192) /27 gives you eight networks (255.255.255.224) ... See a pattern here, they go by the powers of two. Here is my range: 192.168.50.1 - 192.168.50.254 - Original (255.255.255.0) Subnet Ranges all of them are equal and subnet mask is 255.255.255.224 192.168.50.1 - 192.168.50.30 192.168.50.33 - 192.168.50.62 192.168.50.65 - 192.168.50.94 192.168.50.97 - 192.168.50.126 192.168.50.129 - 192.168.50.158 192.168.50.161 - 192.168.50.191 192.168.50.193 - 192.168.50.222 192.168.50.225 - 192.168.50.254 Does that make sense of how I found them?

The Nexus replaces the built-in switch in VMware and installs a virtual machine called the VSM (Virtual Supervisor Module) and depending on the configuration you can have two VSMs for redundancy. These VSMs can be either virtual or a hardware appliance (Nexus 1010) Depending on how many ESX hosts you have in your environment each of them will have VEM (Virtual Ethernet Module) which are the work horses and provide packet forwarding. The VSMs and VEMs make up a single Nexus 1000v switch, which appears to be a single modular switch to the network technician. Each VSM can have a maximum of 64 VEMs (or 64 physical ESX hosts) It has always been that server administrators deal with the operating system and the applications running on that server. While the network administrators manage the switches and related policies. The link between the server and switch usually a cable separates these roles, until virtual came along and smashed these roles together usually the server administrator has to deal with it. With the Nexus 1000v these roles are now separate in the virtual environment with added functionality like PVLANs, receive rate limiting, QoS, Access Control Lists (ACLs), DHCP snooping, SPAN, ERSPAN, AAA, NetFlow, SNMP and many other features that are not available with the VMware vSwitch. Check out this marketing video that summarizes the Nexus 1000v. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgksWMUBmcI] I hope this information is helpful, check back in a couple of weeks or so because I want to go through the process of setting up the Nexus 1000v, understanding some basic terminology of the Nexus 1000v and go over the CLI.

This routing protocol requires less processing time, less memory, and less network design than compared to OSPF. What's the catch? This protocol is Cisco proprietary, if you have a network that uses non-Cisco routers, EIGRP will not and cannot be used on those routers. (Edit: Cisco has open this up to the IETF but you could still see issues if you found a vendor that supported EIGRP and not all features are supported***) EIGRP does not really fit into a specific spot of either Link-State or Distance vector, instead it stands on its own and is called hybrid routing protocol. EIGRP has tree tables it keeps a track of, EIGRP Neighbor, the topology table, and routing table:\nEIGRP Neighbor – EIGRP router sends Hello messages which discover potential neighboring routers that are running EIGRP. This checks that basic parameters to decide which routers should be neighbors. (You can view the neighbors by issuing the command show ip eigrp neighbor) Topology Table – When routers are EIGRP neighbors they exchange full topology tables when they are first neighbors, and then only partial updates as needed when the network topology changes. (You can view the topology table by issuing the command show ip eigrp topology) Routing Table –Each router that has a topology table analyzes its own topology table and chooses the lowest cost value to reach each route that has been advertised. (You can view the routing table by issuing the command show ip route) If routers are connected to each other and exchange topology information then the following must be true:\nThey pass the authentication process They both uses the same configured AS number The source IP address used by the Hello messages are in the same subnet The EIGRP K Values match Some other information about EIGRP is that the hello and update messages that EIGRP sends use a multicast IP address of 224.0.0.10. EIGRP uses metrics called Bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load. By default EIGRP uses bandwidth and delay but these values can be changed and added into EIGRP's metric calculation. That's my quick rundown on EIRGP, Check back often as I will have some configuration examples up and go in a little deeper into the EIGRP like talking about successors and feasible successors.

There are some differences between which will be describe in this post, If you would like to learn more about at least the basic configuration of PPP including PAP and CHAP check out the post I wrote about year ago. (Basic PPP Configuration) HDLC was first developed by the ISO Cisco tweaked the protocol sometimes called cHDLC and because of this it only works with Cisco equipment. PPP is defined by RFC 1968 which is an open standard and is able to work on multi-vender equipment. The default setting of a Cisco serial interfaces is to use HDLC encapsulation, You generally don't have to change this unless you are working with multivendor environments. Then you are going to have to change that encapsulation type to PPP or if you want some of the features that PPP offers. PPP offers many features that HDLC does not including the following:\nAuthentication through the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) Compression capabilities with Stacker or Predictor PPP Multilink, the ability to bundle physical channels into a single logical channel. Support for Error detection and error recovery features Encapsulation for multiple routed protocols, including IP, Novell IPX, and AppleTalk Also note that Passwords are case sensitive when using PAP and CHAP. Multilink PPP (MPPP) basically allows us to bundle multiple physical WAN links into one logical link. There are some different reasons for doing this and they generally depend on the network topology, but the common reason is using it over ISDN links to allow the data packets to be broken up into fragments. In turn this fragmentation allows for greater load balancing, where the physical links will carry a similar load than one link carry most of the load. (This is like EtherChannel ). PPP also allows us to enable one of two compression techniques, Stacker or Predictor. Both are enabled with the interface-level command \u0026quot;compress\u0026quot; The differences between the two are beyond the CCNA but a simple web search would do if you are itching for an answer. Like always I hope this short and sweet post is helpful and if you have questions feel free to post them, also give me some other ideas that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.

Remember that when we are trunking it usually carries all VLANs (This can be changed) but there are different ways to make trunking between links happen. When you are in an interface on a Cisco switch you can change the operational mode of that interface by issuing the switchport mode command. There are four commands that can be issued: [code]Switch(config-if)#switchport mode ? access Set trunking mode to ACCESS unconditionally dynamic Set trunking mode to dynamically negotiate access or trunk mode trunk Set trunking mode to TRUNK unconditionally[/code]\nSwitchport mode access – Which prevents the interface from trunking, this interface would always act as an access port. Switchport mode trunk – Which puts the interface in trunking Switchport mode dynamic auto – The interface waits to receive a trunk negotiation message, at which point the switch would respond and negotiate whether to use trunking. If so which type of trunking. Switchport mode dynamic desirable – Initiates negotiation messages and responds to negotiation messages to dynamically choose whether to start using trunking. This also decides which type of trunking to use. The best security practice I always use is hard code these interface (either access or trunk), there is no need for these to negotiate trunking behaviors. If somebody plugged in a switch or used a tool to trick the switch in believing it is a trunk port they now can listen to all traffic in your network! That is really it for the different types of trunking modes, if I have two switches together and both of them are in dynamic auto, what would the interface operational mode be? Would it be a Trunk or an access? The answer would be an access, because of they are both waiting for a trunk negotiation message. I hope this information is helpful and if you have a question post it below also see if you can figure out if the interface would be trunking or if it would be in an access port.\nAccess + Access =?

By having VLANs you are segmenting the network and the only way to get to the other side is having a router. I have already configured the Cisco switch as posted in Creating VLANs but in summary I have three VLANs total VLAN 1 which is the native VLAN, VLAN 2 and VLAN 3 (which is called support. If you like to understand how create VLANs on a switch follow the post above. If you look at the network topology below you can see where Cisco came up with the name \u0026quot;Router on Stick\u0026quot; each PC is on its own network and needs the router in order for traffic to pass between the networks. Like before I have three VLANs total. VLAN 1 which is the native VLAN, VLAN 2 and VLAN 3 (which is called \u0026quot;Support\u0026quot;).\nYou have to create sub-interfaces on the router to route between different VLANs these sub-interfaces do not correspond to the VLANs so you could put any number but for manageability usually people use the same sub-interface has the VLAN ID. To create a sub-interface start typing the interface that will be physically connected to the switch at the end add a period and number.\n1Router#config t 2Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. 3Router(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/0.2 4Router(config-subif)# You are now in the sub-interface configuration, we want to tell the router which VLAN this interface will be a part of. In this example I am typing \u0026quot;encapsulation dot1Q 2\u0026quot; dot1Q is an IEEE standard 802.1Q , the number \u0026quot;two\u0026quot; is the VLAN this interface will be a part of. Just like a real interface this interface must have an IP address for end devices to reach it. In this example we are using 192.168.2.1 with a Class C subnet mask. (i.e 255.255.255.0)\n1Router(config-subif)#encapsulation dot1Q 2 2Router(config-subif)#ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0 3Router(config-subif)#no shut We do the same for VLAN 3 (Support) in which we will create a new sub-interface in this example I am using sub-interface 3, and I'm going to be putting this sub-interface in VLAN 3 by using \u0026quot;encapsulation dot1Q 3\u0026quot;. Remember the sub-interface number has no effect on which VLAN this interface is a part of. I'm also adding a IP address of 192.168.3.1 with a Class C subnet mask.\n1Router#config t 2Enter configuration commands, one per line.

Go into configuration mode and for this example we selected FastEthernet0/1 apply the \u0026quot;switchport mode trunk\u0026quot; command and since we are using the default native VLAN which is not always recommended that's all the configuration needed. We now have three different networks separated by VLANs, if you issue a \u0026quot;show ip route\u0026quot; on the router we will see each sub-interface and route to each of them.

Thanks, Kevin\nRyan - Jun 5, 2012\nHey Kevin, The only reason this is set on the physical interface is because it is using un-tagged traffic also know as the native VLAN. You can't set the encapsulation dot1q on a physical interface only sub-interfaces. A better way to do this is use a sub-interface followed by: encapsulation dot1Q [VLAN-ID] native I don't see any problems with this method besides security and monitoring. For example If you wanted to see all traffic passing in and out of the physical interface using Netflow or SNMP you would not see that in this example, you would only see the native VLAN traffic. For security you should not use the native VLAN in production so this example it is not using best practices therefore I would not recommend it. This post goes along with another post I did about creating VLANs on a switch: http://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/01/creating-vlans/ Hope that Helps, Ryan\nPart 1 – The Joys of Subnetting! | Cisco Skills - Apr 0, 2012\n[...] Configure Router on a Stick (ciscoskills.net) [...]\nPart 2 – The Joys of Subnetttting – VLSM! | Cisco Skills - Apr 1, 2012\n[...] Configure Router on a Stick (ciscoskills.net) [...]\nHow to configure a Catalyst 3750/3750-E/3750-X Series Switches Using LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) « Pete's Packet - Mar 4, 2012\n[...] Configure Router on a Stick [...]\nRyan - Jan 2, 2012\nIf you are talking about the trunk link between the switch and the router it will pass up to the router and then be forwarded back down to the switch. So if you had a lot of traffic being forwarded between networks you could run into some bandwidth limits. To fix that you could configure a switch that does layer 3 routing and skip the router all together that way you would not be dependent on that one link to forward all of your traffic back and forth. The native VLAN by default is VLAN 1 and that can be changed. The only difference between a native VLAN and a regular VLAN is it passes un-tagged traffic. If you look at the router configuration I've setup, the physical interface (fa0/0) notice how I don't have to put the encapsulation, because this is traffic is not tagged with a VLAN. To answer you question you can put everything on a VLAN and forget about the default/native VLAN. A good practice to use is to change it to a non-default number something other than 1 and a VLAN that you are not using in your network. However make sure every switch has the correct native VLAN or you will get messages about native VLAN mismatched. Ryan\nPhilip - Feb 4, 2012\nGreat article! Thanks for the info.

Thanks for sharing. Can you confirm that with intervlan routing, that one would not run into the bandwidth limitations imposed by a traditional upstream router? (e.g. say, 50 ports feeding upstream to a physical router only to pipe back down into the switch). In other words, is a router on a stick configuration smart enough to know that if it needs to route across two VLANs that happen to live on the same port, that it isolates the flow of traffic to just that port? I'm also interested in what your thoughts are on the default VLAN 1. It seems that it is often more than just the factory VLAN, but that it may hold special characteristics and limitations (e.g. routing, etc.). If that is the case, would you suggest taking a new stack of switches, and making all of the untagged ports to the systems/workstations on something like VLAN101, with a PVID of 101, so as to prevent any traffic from going across the default VLAN?\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2012/01/31/configure-router-on-a-stick/","section":"post","tags":["Cisco","Cisco Inter-Switch Link","ICND1","ICND2","IEEE 802.1Q","IP address","networking","router","Subnetwork","Tutorial","Virtual LAN"],"title":"Configure Router on a Stick"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/collapsed-core/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"collapsed core"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/hierarchical-network/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"hierarchical network"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/network-layer/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Network Layer"},{"body":" network_switch Working towards the CCNA Cisco talks about a hierarchical network there are three layers to this design. Access Layer, distribution layer and the core layer. Each of them have their own set of functions and is also considered to be a best practice when the network continues to grow and for redundancy along with just a better way to manage it. The Access layer is the layer that devices connect to, such as PCs, printers, and IP Phones. The access layer can include routers, switches, bridges, hubs, wireless access points, etc. The main purpose is providing a means of connecting devices to the network, this is also your first line of defense of controlling who is on your network. The Distribution Layer aggregates the data received from the access layer before it is transmitted to the core for routing to its destination. The distribution layer is like a traffic cop to which it controls the flow of network traffic using policies like routing between broadcast domains by having VLANs which are setup on the access layer. VLANs let you segment traffic on a switch into separate subnetworks. Why would you segment traffic? The main reason is for security you should not have sensitive data on a public network because anybody can reach it, by separating it you also have more control over it on who can get access to it. The Core Layer of the hierarchical design is the high-speed backbone of the network. The core layer is critical for interconnectivity between the distribution layer devices. The core must be highly available and should be redundant. The core can also connect to internet resources, because the core aggregates the traffic from the entire distribution layer it must be able to handle high data traffic. Hierarchical Layers In small networks it is a common practice to use a collapsed core model to where the distribution layer and core are merged into one layer. If the network grows it is fairly easy to add the core layer. Because you are in hierarchical network you have many benefits which I'll hold off for another day but in summary they are:\nScalability Redundancy Performance Security Manageability Maintainability Like always I hope this information is helpful in at least having a better idea of Cisco's hierarchical network design. One of the hardest things when designing this type of network is if you are trying to change the original one because of poor performance and degradation.

This is a fault-tolerant technique that is becoming a common setup in highly available, core devices. Cisco has come up with their own proprietary version call EtherChannel. The open standard that IEEE approved is 802.3ad which works with other venders and is often called LAG for short. Why would I use EtherChannel? One big benefit is bandwidth you can combine up to eight parallel links and depending on the port speed and the physical cable you could in theory get up to 80 Gbit/s per second! (Using SPF+ links which can get up 10G a piece in theory) Etherchannel aggregates traffic across all available active ports which make it look like one logical cable. EtherChannel Although this sounds wonderful and it is there are some things to keep in mind. EtherChannel does not always distribute the traffic equally across all available links it depends on the number of links you have connected but even that does not always guarantee equal traffic. EtherChannel hands-out values 0-7 (that's why you can only have up to eight links) on each link. Some of those links may have more than one value assigned to them this makes balancing the traffic not always equal. So looking at the table below if we were using five physical links and every link was in theory in perfect distribution three of those links would be receiving twice as much traffic than the other two links. EtherChannel Table If every link was in perfect distribution you could have physical links of two, four, or eight. But this depends on the usage of a particular device because Etherchannel does not load balance between physical links if one link becomes oversaturated it will drop packets. Etherchannel can look at the following methods to decide which physical link to send data over.\nThe source MAC address The destination MAC address The source and destination MAC address The source IP address The destination IP address The source and destination IP address The source port The destination port The source and destination port All of these methods depend on the hardware and software you are running but they will put a value between 0-7 on each connected link. Remember each link can have more than one value assigned to it. I hope this information is helpful and you are welcome to ask questions or comment.

So such as if you were operating routers at a core level you could color code the CLI to the color red, and the branch routers green and etc. I wasn't sure if this would possible but doing some searching through the internet I found a guy Ivan Pepelnjak who wrote how to do this a couple years ago and wrote a couple books as well, check out his blog/website at http://www.ipspace.net there is tons of helpful information along with his original guide here. Being able to color the text output when connecting to a device, and having each different color have a different meaning to it makes it easier to understand which devices are part of the critical network. So now core devices can have a red text to them , branch devices can have a green color and redundant devices blue etc. This makes it easier to know what you are connecting to and anybody else that is authorized to do so. To make this process happen there has to be escape sequences somewhere in the router to change the color of the text. There is not a command on the router itself to change the color the text, so how would you change the color? What Ivan pointed out was the MOTD banner (Message-of-the-day) therefore when you connect to the device either with console, telnet, or SSH the color of the text will change to the color you specified right when you log into the device. To change the color of the CLI text output in a router go into global configuration mode and type banner motd and then your delimiting character. (For this example I used \u0026quot;*\u0026quot;) [code]Router#config t Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. Router(config)#banner motd *[/code] The next step is to press CTRL+V, release then the ESC key. This is the escape sequence and looks like this in CLI ^[ . The next setup is to add another left bracket [ then the number 3 followed by the number that represents the color:\nIntensity\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNormal\nBlack\nRed\nGreen\nYellow\nBlue\nMagenta\nCyan\nWhite\nBright\nBlack\nRed\nGreen\nYellow\nBlue\nMagenta\nCyan\nWhite\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#cite_ref-5 So if I wanted to change the color to a green color the output would look something like this: [code]^[[32;[/code] Although we are close we need to add the letters \u0026quot;1m\u0026quot; which is an ASCI code sequence, after the number and then the text of banner. So the output would look something like this below: [code]^[[32;1mThis is a test only, don't panic!*[/code] That's it! You can test this by logging off the router and your text output should be the color you specified in the login banner and the same color below the login banner. Color Code G I am still a trying to figure out a way to change the color of just the banner only and not the device text, but I'm a novice with the escape sequences and control codes. Feel free to post below with ideas. I have tested this with a Cisco IOS router but not a switch, I would take a guess in saying it is the same commands to change the color.

That may sound like a drawback but it is excellent job security! Engineers or administrators must watch the performance of an organization's network to make sure that productivity is not affected. Network outages can have a huge effect on an organization, lost revenue and the cost of unproductive employees can severely damage the organization, Earlier this year I also talked about the troubleshooting process which goes hand in hand with network troubleshooting. One of the major things a network engineer or administrator needs to have is documentation of the network. That may sound like common sense and it is but with outdated documentation or no documentation at all makes it difficult to diagnose where the problem is and even more difficult if more help is needed from outside sources. Just with your computer, car and home, networks need to have a regular maintenance from time to time. Spending time on an operational network can improve its performance and uptime. Instead using the \u0026quot;duct tape\u0026quot; approach when outages occur. So we know documentation is important but it always seems to be on the backburner, \u0026quot;I'll get to it when there is time to burn\u0026quot; From my recent experience working with a hospital is that when things went down I had no idea where to start, the documentation was outdated twice over and let's just say the problem could have been fixed in 5 minutes instead of an hour. Needless to say I broke out Microsoft Visio and worked from the ground up. Having documentation is good idea but the kicker is to remember to update it when changes occur :). Simple problems are usually simple solutions, we all have been there, a problem comes up 5 minutes before heading home and the problem itself is simple but for whatever reason the solution cannot be found. From my experience from troubleshooting labs and real world environments I have found that looking at the whole problem helps and take it one step at a time. For example a server or PC no longer has network access, does another PC or server that's on the same network able to use the resources needed? Continue to use the Troubleshooting Process and ask those simple questions until the solution is found. Don't cover your tracks! I have done this couple of times myself, when configuring a device like a router, switch, firewall etc. no matter how simple the configuration change seems to be always, copy the commands to a text file after you configured the device. Or better yet copy the commands to a text document first, read it through to make sure it seems correct and if something fails reverse the command. Don't copy-run start! This kind of goes with the one above but this method has saved me in some sketchy areas. When I take an already working device and throw some extra commands on it and now it disconnects from the network making an already problem worse than before. A simple reload or a pull of a power plug brings the device up before I made those changes. Once I have confirmed that those commands worked I then issue the famous copy run start command. Monitor your network, How do you know what \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; looks like when you have nothing looking at it? There are tons of paid and free tools to help you find that \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; network load. So when something happens outside of normal you know about it. Some tools that I have worked with are PRTG, MRTG, Syslog servers like Kiwi Syslog, I have also heard of Nagios, WhatsUp Gold, and much more. A simple search will point you in the right direction ;). I hope this information is helpful when troubleshooting networks because although it can be a headache sometimes it's my favorite part of the job.

OSPF currently has three versions and the first version was in the 1980s when the internet was still being used for research. What is interesting about the first version of OSPF is although one version ran on routers the other type of version ran on UNIX computers. When OSPFv2 come out in the 1990s the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was working on another routing protocol called IS-IS (Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System). OSPF is considered to be an interior gateway protocol which is like IS-IS but unlike OSPF IS-IS runs on the data-link layer while OSPF runs at layer three the network layer. OSPF is considered to be a link-state protocol, unlike RIP, RIPv2 and IGRP , this protocol is what OSPF shines on. Instead of looking at hop-count like RIP, OSPF looks at the cost of the link. Take for example the picture below, two routes are available to the destination. One is one hop away while the other is two hops away. If we are using RIP then the route with the least amount of hops is the preferred route. However if OSPF was running it would look at the cost of the link like the bandwidth of the link. In this example the link with the lowest hop count is also the slowest of the two links. So OSPF would use the link with the highest hop count but in this example that link is also the fastest out of the two.\nOSPF Hop vs Bandwidth What makes OSPF also a feature is it supports multiple venders instead of Cisco. OSPF is recognized by RFC 2328 and RFC 2740 (IPv6). Compared to RIP OSPF is fast to converge and is able to scale better to larger networks unlike RIP which can only scale to 16 hops and converges slowly compared to OSPF. OSPF has different packet types or LSPs (Link-State Packets) which help OSPF function like it should:\nHello packets Like the name suggest these packets are like keep-alives and maintain adjacent with other OSPF routers. The meaning of a hello packet is to discover OSPF neighbors and set up adjacencies. In order for each router to form a neighbor the routers must agree on hello interval, dead timer and network type. DBD - Database description which has a short list of the sending router's link state database which is checked against the local link state database. LSR - Routers receiving OSPF information can ask more information about any entry in the DBD by sending a link-state request (LSR) LSU - (Link-state update) Packets used to reply to LSRs and to announce new information. These packets contain seven different types of link-state advertisements (LSA). This goes into a deeper topic that is aimed at the CCNP level, in short LSA and LSUs can be used interchangeably. A LSU has one or more LSAs and a LSA contains route information for destination routes, just remember at the CCNA level their are different types of LSAs which fall under LSUs. Confused? I'll stop :) LSAck- When an LSU is recived, the router sends a link-state acknowledgment to confirm the router received the LSU. OSPF does elect a DR (Designated Router) and a BDR (Backup Designated Router) The DR's job is to update all other OSPF routers which a called DROthers. when a change happens when using the multiaccess network the BDR monitors the DR and takes over as the DR if the current DR fails. That's my introduction in to OSPF and it is a somewhat complex protocol that needs a complete understanding before going deeper into the beast! Like always I hope this information helps if you have an idea of the next topic I should cover either with ICND1 or ICND2 comment below.

I like to think of Dell CLI like a dumb downed version of the Cisco CLI so I had some time to play around with a Dell 6248P switch and wanted to figure out how to get SSH working in the thing. Couple searches around the web and some guess and check methods I was able to get SSH working and disable telnet sessions from connecting to the switch. Compared to a Cisco switch dell has few commands when configuring SSH. This switch was configured with an IP address and user name and passwords before I touched it but I don't think would too hard to figure out. :) So if you never touched a Dell switch like I have but worked with Cisco CLI you'll find that it is similar which is nice feature, I used telnet to remote into the switch which is insecure and sends information in plain text, which is why we are moving to SSH. So after typing the username and password I was prompted a familiar sign. I typed enable to get into privilege EXEC mode. [code]EdgeSW0D\u0026gt;enable[/code] From there I found a command that will display your public keys on the device that is if you have any. The command was show crypto key mypubkey (Notice how no keys have been configured yet) [code]EdgeSW0D#show crypto key mypubkey RSA Key is not Generated yet ! DSA Key is not Generated yet ![/code] From privilege EXEC mode I typed configure on the prompt, once I was in there I found the crypto command and generated some DSA keys with the following command: **crypto key generate dsa ** [code]EdgeSW0D#configure EdgeSW0D(config)#crypto key generate dsa DSA key generation started, this may take a few minutes................ DSA key generation complete.[/code] Under the configuration mode I also noticed the ip ssh server command but once I hit enter I got the following error: [code]EdgeSW0D(config)#ip ssh server SSH could not be enabled.[/code] It took me awhile to figure this issue out, I played around with a another Dell switch and at least to what I found out online and my guess and check methods I noticed that the command ip ssh server works only when both DSA and RSA keys are configured. It does not matter that order as long as switch has both of them and the version of the Dell switch I used when writing post this was the latest version 3.3. Once I created RSA keys with the already created DSA keys the command ip ssh server went through. To create RSA keys it is the same command but substitute DSA with RSA. crypto key generate rsa [code]EdgeSW0D(config)#crypto key generate rsa RSA key generation started, this may take a few minutes..... RSA key generation complete. EdgeSW0D(config)#ip ssh server[/code] Go ahead and leave the telnet session open and connect to the switch via SSH to verify SSH is working so you don't lock yourself out. I issued the command show sessions to see that I have two sessions with this switch Telnet and SSH. [code]EdgeSW0D#show sessions Connection Host Address Port ---------- ----------------------- ----------------------- ----------- 0 172.27.227.67 172.27.227.67 Telnet 1 172.27.227.67 172.27.227.67 SSH [/code] Once I verified that SSH is working I can disable telnet so only SSH connections are allowed and accepted, with the following command ip telnet server disable. [code]EdgeSW0D#configure EdgeSW0D(config)#ip telnet server disable[/code] That's it! If you want a refresh on how Cisco does it check the blog post I posted back in March Configuring SSH.

These different modes have positive and negative effects which depend on the type of network environment that runs through them! Store-and-forward is just like the name suggests, the switch receives a frame on a port and stores the frame in it's memory buffer until the frame has been completely received. The switch analyzes the frame for information about its destination and uses CRC (cyclic redundancy check) a mathematical formula based on the number of 1 bits in the frame to decide whether the frame has an error. After confirming its integrity the frame is forward out the correct port and toward its destination. If a frame is corrupted the switch discards it and less bandwidth is wasted on the unusable frame. Some other useful information about store and forward switching is it is required for QoS (Quality of Service). Cut-through switching acts on the data as soon as it is received, even if the transmission is not complete! The switch only buffers enough of the frame to read the destination MAC address so that it can then decide were to send the frame. This is located in the first 6 bytes of the frame. The switch looks at the MAC address in its own MAC address table and starts to forward the frame. The switch does not perform any error checking on the frame because it can start forwarding the frame immediately after the first 6 bytes. Cut-through switching is faster than store-and-forward but because there is no error checking if there is corrupt frames the switch forwards them into the network using up bandwidth the end device would eventually discard the frame. There is also another type of cut-through switching which is fragment-free switching. This is the best of both worlds, it stores the first 64 bytes of the frame Why only 64 bytes? Most problems occur at the first 64 bytes of the frame like collisions. The switch tries to enhance cut-through by using a small error check and then forwards the frame. That's my post about these methods of switching both are good and bad depending on the network environment.

This certification which was introduced this summer now has questions about it from CLN (Cisco Learning Network) and other Cisco sites. So what is this new cert and any changes to ICND1 or ICND2? Short answer is no, this certification is on par with ICND1 or CCENT according to Cisco but is focused on support groups like TAC (Technical Assistance Center), NOC (Network Operations Centers) and 3rd party support. Also this exam focuses on more hardware products instead of theory like in ICND and ICND2. People who are certified in this area are opened up to more Cisco products and services compared people who take ICND1 and or CCNA. If you do have this certification and a CCNA or CCENT you can renew it by taking the ICND2 or ICND1 and renew the CCT certification. These certs work together but offer a different path to follow the CCT is focused on hot swaps, troubleshooting and working for TACs.

Let's continue are discussion about redundancy in the layer two environment. To review what STP does (Spanning Tree Protocol) it works at layer two of the OSI model. If more than one path is available in the network the STP algorithm basically shutdowns the redundant links until the active link is unavailable (shutdown, disabled, etc.) So although there are multiple links connected physically to offer redundancy, logically the switches in the network only see one path that Ethernet frame can travel. Remember without STP networks would be on the fritz when we introduce redundancy in the environment. STP or IEEE 802.1D is an open standard so it is not just on Cisco equipment but others as well which helps in a multivendor situation. So how does looping occur without the use STP? Looking at the picture below we can see the broadcasts frames are flooding the network which is by design but the thing that changes is these broadcasts will continue to flood the network because there is on TTL (Time-To-Live) on the data link layer of the OSI model. As more packets are passed and created the network will become slower and slower and eventually devices on the network will become unavailable this called a broadcast storm. [caption id=\u0026quot;attachment_1534\u0026quot; align=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;584\u0026quot; caption=\u0026quot;STP Loop Example (Broadcast Storm)\u0026quot;] STP Loop [/caption] There are also more problems when not using STP besides broadcast storms like the MAC address table becoming unstable in each switch. This causes the MAC table to be unreliable because of the looping frames in the network. These frames are usually sent to the wrong locations in the network. Multiple frames can also be a problem because of looping frames multiple frames appear on the network and if they are delivered to the intended host it can confuse the host and more likly drop the frames. So looking at the same picture but with STP enabled we can see that broadcast frame will travel the network without looping. On S1 one of the ports is in a blocking state and blocks all traffic coming into that port and traffic coming out of that port. [caption id=\u0026quot;attachment_1539\u0026quot; align=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;584\u0026quot; caption=\u0026quot;STP Enabled\u0026quot;] STP Enable [/caption] The magic about STP is when the link between S2 and S3 becomes disconnected it will bring the link between S2 and S1 online and continue to send packets! When the link becomes available again it switch back to blocking on S1. So let's stop there for now and check back next week to see the last chapter of STP, how does it calculate which switch goes to blocking? What other advantages does STP offer? That's all next week, I hope this information is helpful and if you have an idea of the next topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me hear it!\nRelated articles The Beginnings of Layer Two Redundancy (ciscoskills.net) Belt and braces stop the network falling down (go.theregister.com) Resiliency and Redundancy - NOT the same (avaya.com) Cisco Nexus vPC Configuration and Spanning-Tree Elimination (techbookshelf.com) Cisco Discovery Protocol (ciscoskills.net) Comments: Ryan - Sep 3, 2011\nSteve do you have any questions?

Only the directly connected routes can't remember? Check out this post Distance Vector Routing. Link state protocols are faster to converge network changes compared to distance vector however when compared to distance vector setup they can be harder to set up, maintain, and troubleshoot when problems arise. Although the core design of a link-state protocol is like distance vector, meaning it will send updates to neighboring routers, it does this in an entirely different way. Routers that use link-state advertise every possible route in the network. This process is called flooding which means every router in the network has the same information. This information is stored in RAM and called the link-state database (LSDB). The link-state protocol uses this information for other process, like to calculate the \u0026quot;best routes\u0026quot; to each subnet. You can probably guess that when using a link-state protocol it will use more resources like CPU and memory compared to distance vector, Your' right. The link-state protocols relay on LSAs (Link-state advertisements) which are broken down in two main types:\nRouter LSA - Includes the a number to identify the router called the router ID. The router's interface IP address, subnet masks, the state of link (Up or Down), and the cost of the interface. Link LSA- Which identifies each link the subnet and the routers that are attached to that link. It also identifies if the link is either up or down. These LSAs are created by the router and then floods the LSA to other routers their neighbors. The thing that makes link-state protocol a topic starter is that they look at the \u0026quot;Link\u0026quot; of the connection and advertise each interface even if the connection is up or down. The LSDB has information about not only the up and working routers, interfaces, and networks, but all routers and interfaces even if the interfaces are down. With link-state protocols it creates a complete network topology in each router unlike distance vector.\nWhich IP Routing Protocols use Link-State? Take a guess!\nFeature\nRIPv1\nRIPv2\nEIGRP\nOSPF\nIS-IS\nClassless\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSupports VLSM\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSend Subnet Mask\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nDistance Vector\nYes\nYes\nNo *\nNo\nNo\n*EIGRP is considered a hybrid routing protocol (Uses the best of both Distance Vector and Link-State protocols) In some Cisco documentation EIGRP is also referred to as an advance distance vector protocol. Link-State Protocols converge much quickly than distance vector, they do consume more RAM and CPU when compared to distance vector. They avoid routing loops by default unlike with distance vector which requires more features like split horizon. Distance vector is easier to set up when compared to link-state which requires more thought when configuring it correctly. I have opened another door towards the ICND2 path, so let's stop for now and let it sink-in. Like always you have power of the internet at your hands if you can't wait a simple search will do.

Which is one of the best methods (I think) to begin network troubleshooting. When part of the network goes down it is sometimes hard to figure out why? When you issue the ping command or the extended ping command in a Cisco router several ICMP codes can come up on the router. Let's discuss them! The first status code \u0026quot;!\u0026quot; (Exclamation mark) is a good sign, when you issued the Ping command from the router it was able to get a ICMP echo reply from the device you specified in the command. This also verifies that routing is also working. If you get a reply from the device you are pinging it usually means everything is up and running. The next status code \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; (Period) is usually not a good sign. When you issued the ping command from the router it was not able to get a reply back from the device you are pinging along with the router unable to get any other traffic like an ICMP unreachable before the ICMP packet expired. This usually means the router does not have a route to the specified IP address. The third status code\u0026quot;U\u0026quot; means that the router received an ICMP unreachable packet. There is route for the specified IP address in the router's routing table however the device did not respond and is unavailable. So the router that has a route to that device sends back an ICMP Unreachable packet to the device that sent the ping. The fourth status code \u0026quot;N\u0026quot; means the router received an ICMP unreachable packet but instead of destination host unreachable this is a network/subnet unreachable. If the router receives an IP packet that is destined to another network but can not send the packet based on its own routing table it will send an ICMP unreachable packet with the network/subnet code. These are the most common ICMP codes that you could run into. There are others like the ICMP \u0026quot;can't fragment\u0026quot; which would result in the code\u0026quot;M\u0026quot; this would happen when the router needs to fragment the ICMP packet but in the packet itself a flag in the IP header can be set not to fragment the packet. The router would discard the packet and issue the code. Pings are always a good troubleshooting tool but ICMP is only helpful if you know some the ICMP codes which makes it easier for you to troubleshoot the problem. Like always I hope this information is helpful, if you have an idea about a topic in ICND1 or ICND2 let me know!

Hardware will eventually fail, bottlenecks will appear, and the speed of our network will become slower when we max the bandwidth on links. So having redundancy in routers, connections, and having a hierarchy network is one of best choices to make when improving the efficiently of the network. But in the OSI model there is one layer that can't have redundancy at least logically and that is Layer two of the OSI model. If you follow this blog way back when I talked about the OSI model, layer two belongs to the switches and by design the ethernet frame does not support a TTL (Time-To-Live) like the IP packet. So bring forth STP, the Spanning Tree Protocol which works at layer two of the OSI model. If more than one path is available in the network the STP algorithm basically shutdowns the redundant links until active link is unavailable (shutdown, disabled, etc.) So although there are multiple links connected physically to offer redundancy, logically the switches in the network only see one path that ethernet frame can travel. Your Thought:\nWait...I have plugged into multiple Cisco switches before to create a redundant path and I did not notice anything wrong?\nThat's because by default STP is enabled, to the average person they can plug away and create redundant paths with switches and cause no harm to the network. But if STP has been disabled on those switches or switches that don't support STP (dumb switches), a Layer 2 loop can occur. A Layer 2 loop is a nightmare if this happens in a production network and can happen in seconds. Loops result in high CPU load on all switches caught in the loop. Because the same frames are constantly being forwarded back and forth between all switches in the loop, the CPU of the switch ends up having to process a lot of data. This slows down performance on the switch when legitimate traffic arrives. A host caught in a network loop is not accessible to other hosts on the network. Because the MAC address table is constantly changing with the updates from the broadcast frames, the switch does not know which port to send the unicast frames out to reach the destination. The unicast frames end up looping around the network as well. As more and more frames end up looping on the network, a broadcast storm occurs. What makes this even more fun is if you try connecting to the switches to solve this problem, good luck :). Most of the time you have to physically turn off the switches to kill the broadcast storm and if it happened once expect it to happen again. To make things worse if any end-devices are connected to the switch ports that are experiencing a broadcast storm they too have a hard time keeping up with the mountain of broadcast frames being sent and sometimes malfunction. Usually you would have to disconnect the switch from the redundant links and apply STP to it and then re-connect the redundant links in order for your network to be broadcast storm free. Although I'm just getting started I think by just introducing this topic will help you better understand it later, I will get into more of this STP magic and how this really helps us design a hierarchy network. Like always I hope this information was informative and if you can't wait a simple search about STP will help. You can also go right to the source for more STP information at Cisco's Support and Documentation.

Before August comes up I wanted to post at least one more topic which deals with the wireless side of the networking world. Ever heard of Super WiFi? The IEEE has published this standard recently its official number is 802.22. What does Super WiFi bring to the table compared to other WiFi Standards? Well according to IEEE these speeds can bring up to 22Mbps to devices as far has 62 miles! How is this range possible? Well ever since the United States made the switch to digital over the air broadcasts there was this \u0026quot;extra space\u0026quot; This space was at first used for Microsoft, Google and other big companies to experiment this \u0026quot;extra space\u0026quot; or also called white space. In September of 2010 the FCC approved this and it is now been standardized by the IEEE. The Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) is expected to use a point-to-multi-point system (P2MP) You can get more information by doing a simple search in your favorite search engine about this Super WiFi. I thought I posted about this way back in January but I guess not. What do you think? Do you think this technology will take off? In what parts of the country do you think this would be more popular?

This protocol helps us in two ways, it first helps us verify that a connection between router or switch is set up correctly at least up to layer two in the OSI model. This also helps us discover Cisco devices that are in are network and which interfaces these devices are connected too and from are Cisco equipment. The Cisco discovery protocol is Cisco proprietary and before I go any further let me mention that CDP is a security risk because of the detailed information CDP gives out which helps you has a network administrator build a current network infrastructure, this can also hurt you because this information can easily be sniffed by programs that are easily searched on the internet. So what is the purpose of CDP? CDP can gather device information from neighboring switches and routers without the need for a password. Like mentioned before this is great for troubleshooting a problem, discovering new devices that are not documented in your network topology, and verifying that each device is physically connected to the correct interfaces according to network documentation. CDP can discover the following details from neighboring devices that support CDP:\nDevice Identifier: The hostname of the device Address List: Network and data-link addresses Local Interface: The interface on the switch or router issuing the command Show CDP Port Identifier: Identifies the port used by the device to send CDP messages Capabilities List: Information on what the device is like a router or a switch Platform: The model and the OS running on the device Since CDP is enabled by default it does create a security risk, Cisco recommends that CDP be disabled on all interfaces that do not have need for it. You can disable CDP in two ways, by each interface with the sub-command no cdp enable under the interface you wish to disable CDP. Or you can also disable CDP globally within the router or switch with the command no cdp run under the configuration mode. That's just some general information about CDP and why CDP is useful. Although CDP could be a security risk it's still a helpful protocol to get some detailed information about your Cisco devices for inventory or to update your network topology. It can also be useful to just verify that the physical layer and data-link layer are working correctly for troubleshooting purposes.

Although these protocols fundamentally do the same thing by getting information on remote networks they get this information in a different way. For today let's introduce distance vector routing. With a distance vector routing protocol, a router learns about a route to a different network (that's the purpose of a routing protocol) the router only knows the \u0026quot;distance\u0026quot; to get there this is usually called the metric. The router also knows the next-hop router along with the outgoing interface to use when sending a packet destined to that network and that's it. You could say that a distance vector protocol does not give a graphical representation of the entire network. Look at the picture below R1 has two routes two the network 192.168.3.0. For distance vector the router chooses the lowest metric if this example was using RIP the routers metric would be using hop count and pick the path with the lowest hop count/metric. So although we have multiple routers between R1 and R3, for R1 it only knows and pretty much only cares about the routers that are directly connected to R1 (the red routers) and those are routers are advertising that they have a route reach to R3 (the 192.168.3.0 network.) Distance Vector Which IP Routing Protocols use Distance Vector?\nFeature\nRIPv1\nRIPv2\nEIGRP\nOSPF\nIS-IS\nClassless\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSupports VLSM\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSend Subnet Mask\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nDistance Vector\nYes\nYes\nNo *\nNo\nNo\n*EIGRP is considered a hybrid routing protocol (Uses the best of both Distance Vector and Link-State protocols) In some Cisco documentation EIGRP is also referred to as an advance distance vector protocol.

IPv6 Eye Chart I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea for a topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 let me know about it, also check out my earlier topics that I have posted.\nRelated articles Bing starts testing IPv6 version in preparation for World IPv6 day (winrumors.com) ","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/06/08/world-ipv6-day/","section":"post","tags":["computers","General","Internet","Internet service provider","Internet Society","IP address","ipv4","ipv6","networking","router","software","technology","World IPv6 Day"],"title":"World IPv6 Day!!"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/classful-network/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Classful network"},{"body":" Cloud-Computing-icon Before the internet and general networking become popular into what it is now, there were and still are routing protocols that only do classful routing. What is classful routing? When I was talking about Dynamic Routing earlier (See the post Dynamic Routing Protocols) I mentioned there was a difference between classful routing and classless routing. So in today's post let's focus on these two but important topics when using routing protocols. Let's first talk about classful routing, which is sometimes called a classful network. If you are using a classful routing protocol then all of your networks are in different classes and are separated by a router. Remember that the useable IPv4 address ranges are dived into classes. Class A 1-126, Class B 128-191, and Class C 192-223. So when we talk about a classful routing protocol it will only look at the IP address class and not the subnet mask. This is the problem; if you are using a classful routing protocol you cannot change the subnet mask in any of these networks. You have to use the default subnet mask, so an example is if you have a 172.16.X.X network the default subnet mask is a /16 or 255.255.0.0. So in short you can't have different size networks when using the same IP address class and a classful routing protocol. Remember that classful routing does not support subnet information, and therefore lacking support for VLSM (variable length subnet masks). With classless routing if you took a guess that it supports VLSM and different size networks within the same IP address class then you're catching on ;) Because that is exactly what a classless routing protocol does, so for example we are using a class C address of 192.168.1.0 with a standard subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 or a /24. With a classless routing protocol you can split this network even more instead of having 254 usable hosts in one network; we could have 126 usable hosts with two networks. The ranges for the first network would start at 192.168.1.1 and end at 192.168.1.126, and the second would start at 192.168.1.129 and end at 192.168.1.254. The subnet mask for both of these networks would be 255.255.255.128. With a classful routing protocol it would only look at the class of the address in this case a class \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; and not look at the subnet mask and apply a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 causing these addresses to be in the same network which in reality their not. What Routing Protocol uses Classful and Classless Routing? Take a guess…\nFeature\nRIP-1\nRIP-2\nEIGRP\nOSPF\nIS-IS\nClassless\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSupports VLSM\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSend Subnet Mask\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nThat's my summary for classful and classless routing protocols, I wouldn't say nobody uses a classful routing protocol there's always someone but they are different and will cause connection problems if set up incorrectly. Like always I hope this information was informative and you can always find more information at Cisco or even a search of RFC 1519 and RFC 1817.

A wireless LAN can be uncontrollable has it is just radio waves and anybody can receive them. Having and using good security practices can help you be under control of your wireless LAN. Not having any security in a wireless LAN environment will cause anybody to have access to the network. Some threats that lead to wireless LANs can be the following:\nWar Drivers – These are people who \u0026quot;drive\u0026quot; around to find open networks that are not secure and looking for free internet access. Hackers – These types of people usually have malicious ideas in mind; this can be anything to entering unauthorized systems and stealing data or even harming the physical system. Employees –Although we may have an excellent defense on the outside of our network, we sometimes forget that the inside of our network needs to be secure as well. In the original 802.11 standard there were two types of authentication:\nOpen authentication, which as the name implies has no authentication and will allow anybody to use the network. Shared authentication, which used WEP and is now flawed, The WEP algorithm was weak and WEP was also not very scalable. (See post Cracking WEP) Currently there are two enterprise-level encryption methods which are specified in the 802.11i and are certified as WPA and WPA2:\nTKIP is an encryption method certified has WPA, TKIP supports for legacy WLAN equipment by fixing the flaws with the original 802.11 WEP encryption. TKIP encrypts at the layer 2 (Data Link) payloads and carries a message of integrity check (Message Integrity Check) in the encrypted packet. This helps to make sure the message or packet was not tampered with. AES is an encryption method certified has WPA2, AES has the same functions as TKIP but does use additional data from the MAC header to recognize if the data has been tampered with. Some steps to check when setting up a wireless LAN is the following:\nCheck the wired network, like DHCP and Internet access before setting up a wireless access point. Next install the access point but by keeping it away from devices that could case greater interference . Configure the SSID on the access point. Don't put security on the access point yet. Configure or install one or two wireless clients. Don't put security on these devices yet. Verify wireless network operation within the clients. Check to make sure you can get access to network resources and outside the network. Configure wireless security. Such as WPA2 with PSK . Verify network operation again to make sure that the wireless clients can get access to network resources. For now that's my summary for the basic wireless security, this really goes over the concepts but not the configuration. There are a lot of online guides that can go into the configuration aspect of the wireless client and the access point.

It's the Cisco proprietary VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) which in short means that Cisco switches can exchange VLAN configuration, instead of manually configuring each switch with the same VLANs. I also suggest if you don't know what a VLAN is check out the post Creating VLANs Let's get right into understanding VTP. The thing that makes VTP shine is what it does, although simple to understand it saves time by automatically distributing VLAN information. Take for example if you had 20 switches that need the same VLANs you could do it manually but this runs the risk of human error, with VTP if you configure one switch as a server and all other switches as clients then you can configure all of them. VTP uses Layer two messages to exchange information if a server switch changes or removes VLANS VTP will synchronize all switches so all switches have the same VLANs. VLAN_Trunking_Protocol The VTP server distributes VLAN configuration changes through VTP messages, sent over ISL and 802.1Q trunks.\nISL is an older technology along with being Cisco proprietary. ISL also fully encapsulates the original Ethernet frame inside the ISL header remain unchanged. Along with using the source and destination MAC addresses in the ISL header to send and receiving to a switch. 802.1Q is an open-standard created by IEEE and uses a different header than ISL to tag frames, with the VLAN number. 802.1Q does not encapsulate the original frame into another Ethernet header and trailer. 802.1Q inserts and extra 4-byte VLAN header into the original frame's Ethernet header. The frame still has the original source and destination MAC address unlike ISL. Also because the original header has been expanded 802.1Q forces a FCS (Frame check sequence) By default when a switch is powered on the VTP mode is server, VTP servers and clients can choose whether to react to the received VTP update, by either update their VLAN configuration or ignore it. This is based on the VLAN database configuration revision number. Each time the VTP server modifies its VLAN configuration the VTP server increments the current configuration revision number by 1. If the revision number increases and is higher than a client switch or server switch, it will update its VLAN database. This is where VTP can destroy your network if set up incorrectly or not securely. If you have a \u0026quot;rouge\u0026quot; VTP server that has a higher revision number then the other VTP server, all switches in the domain including the VTP server will change and update the VLAN configuration based on the \u0026quot;rouge\u0026quot; VTP server. There are three VTP Modes\nServer Mode, Servers can create VLANs and distribute VLAN configuration changes through VTP messages. Client Mode, Clients cannot be used to configure VLAN information they only learn about VLANs by VTP servers and only forward VTP messages. Transparent Mode, Transparent mode switches never update their VLAN database on incoming VTP messages. Like servers they can however create VLANs, they also will send VTP messages to help out other switches in server or client. VTP defines three message types\nSummary advertisements - list the revision number, domain name, and other information but no VLAN information. These are summary advertisements that occur every 5 minutes. Subset advertisements - occur when a new a larger revision number is introduced which is some subset of the VLAN database. Request message - Allows the switch to immediately request VTP messages from a neighboring switch as soon as a trunk comes up. VTP does have some other features like VTP Pruning, passwords protection and domains but that all in the configuration side. An interesting side note is that VTP cannot be turned off. There is no disable command in the switch IOS, if you want to turn off VTP on a switch change the mode to transparent. You can find additional information about VTP at Cisco.com along with a web search.

That's where dynamic routing protocols come into play although they are helpful I strongly urge you to understand static routing first. (See the post Configure Static Routing) So for today's post let's get the foundation of understanding dynamic routing protocols. By definition a routing protocol is a set of messages, rules and algorithms used by routers for the overall purpose of learning routes to other networks not physically connected to it. (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP are all examples of routing protocols! When using a dynamic routing protocol routers learn \u0026quot;dynamically\u0026quot; about other remote networks and automatically add these networks to its routing table. However keep in mind that when compared to static routing, dynamic routing require less administrator overhead but they will use the routers resources like, more RAM, more processing time (CPU), and even the network bandwidth Routing_Updates Although there are several routing protocols each of them have their benefits but they all focus on these key things:\nLearn about networks from other neighboring routers and maintain up-to-date routing information. Advertise routing information to neighboring routers and thus discovering remote networks. If more than route is possible the router will pick the best route based on its metric. If the any one part of the network fails, react by advertising the bad routes and advertise the best available route. (Convergence) Before we go any further about dynamic routing protocols remember there are two type of routing protocols used today:\nIGP (Interior Gateway Protocols) A routing protocol that is designed for a single autonomous system. Some common routing protocols classified under IGP are RIP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS. EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocols) A routing protocol that is designed for use in between autonomous systems. A common routing protocol classified under EGP is BGP. IGP and EGP Interior Gateway Protocols are used within a company or organization, once that information leaves the company or organization it moves towards the ISP which would use an Exterior Gateway Protocol EGP. So for the picture above think of the clouds to be the inside of a company or organization and outside of that company or organization the routing protocol would change. For now let's stop there because the dynamic routing protocols open another door, like Distance Vector and Link-state routing protocols, and the difference between classful and classless routing protocols along with the different type of administrative distances and metrics, these discussions for another day. :) Like always I hope this information was informative and if you have a topic that deals with either ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know by commenting below.\nRelated Articles Configure Static Routing (ciscoskills.net) Comments: Classful vs. Classless Routing | Cisco Skills - Jun 3, 2011\n[...] routing.

A router can learn about networks in two ways, manually from configured static routers which we will talk about today and dynamic routing protocols which will talk about on Wednesday. Let's get started! Static routes are not that uncommon they at first need some attention to get set up but after it is working nothing needs to change. A good example of using a static route is with a stub network. A stub network is only accessed by a single router and no other routes are configured so there is only one path the network traffic can take. Notice the picture below and how any traffic going towards the network cloud from the 192.168.1.0 network will always pass the 172.16.5.0 network. Why waste putting a routing protocol here?) Stub Network In order to configure a static route you must be in the global configuration mode, the ip route command complete syntax is the following: ip route prefix mask {ip-address} | interface-type interface-number [ip-address]} [dhcp] [distance] [name next-hop-name] [permanent | track number] [tag tag] For the CCENT/CCNA the complete syntax is not relevant, let's use a simpler version of the ip route syntax: ip route network-address subnet-mask {ip address | exit interface} The network address is the destination network or the remote address that will be added in the routing table. (For the complete syntax this follows on the prefix parameter) The subnet mask is the subnet mask of the remote network that will be added in the routing table. (For the complete syntax this follows on the mask parameter) One or both of the following commands must be configured: The ip-address in the syntax is usually called the next-hop router's IP address The exit-interface is the outgoing interface that would be used in forwarding the packets io the destination network (For the complete syntax this follows on the interface-type interface-number parameter) Looking at the picture above we need to have a static route on R2, we can do these in two ways the first example is using the next hop IP address. (For this example the next hop IP address is 172.16.5.1 R1's serial 0/0/0 interface. The next example is using the exit interface out of R2. [code]R2(config)#ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.5.1[/code] [code]R2(config)#ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 serial 0/0/1[/code] The last thing we need to do in order for this stub network to work is put a default route on R1 because R2 is going to the cloud the (internet or network) any traffic like a web request going to the internet needs to be forwarded to R2. A default route is a route that will match every IP address. Remember that a router does not have every single possible route on the internet or network usually these can be summary routes and default routes. Like on R2 we can do this in two ways, the first example is using the next hop IP address. (For this example the next hop IP address is 172.16.5.2 R2's serial 0/0/1 interface. The next example is using the exit interface out of R1. [code]R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.5.2[/code] [code]R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 serial 0/0/0[/code] That's my tutorial for configuring static routes. Static routes do need some overhead but once you get them working you don't need to even touch it again. You can find more information at Cisco.com and the Cisco Learning Network.

In today's post that's what we are going to be talking about. What is AAA and what are the benefits of using it along with what is it? The first \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; of AAA is Authentication which provides the method of identifying users, including login and password dialog, challenge and response, messaging support, and, depending on the security protocol you select, encryption. The second \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; of AAA is Authorization which provides the method for remote access control, including one-time authorization or authorization for each service, per-user account list and profile, user group support, and support of IP, IPX, ARA, and Telnet. The third and last \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; of AAA is Accounting which provides the method for collecting and sending security server information used for billing, auditing, and reporting, such as user identities, start and stop times, executed commands (such as PPP), number of packets, and number of bytes. In a real world scenario I like to think of AAA has a police officer or a security guard that is blocking access to a building, they first want to make sure that they know who you are and you give the correct credentials that prove to them you are who you say you are. Once they have verified who you are they will want to check if you are authorized to enter the blocked building once they have approved you to have access they will be able to track or keep a record that you accessed the building. That is the same type of idea that the router or switch will do. Months ago I talked about TACACS Plus and RADIUS these are both used to control access to the network. (See the post TACACS Plus and RADIUS) You could say these services are the security guards or police officers. By using AAA it provides the following benefits:\nIncreased flexibility and control of access configuration Scalability Standardized authentication methods, such as RADIUS, TACACS+, and Kerberos Multiple backup systems When you apply AAA to a network you now have full control of each network device that supports AAA. The user database is stored on the RADIUS or TACACS+ server, so instead of configuring and putting passwords and usernames for each network device once you configure a username and password on a AAA server it now can get access to each network resource. You can also give that user certain privileges by specifying if that user can access that device. AAA is like Active Directory in the Windows Server environment. You can do a lot of configuration and really lock down your network infrastructure. AAA is not just for routers and switches in IT environments. This type of service can be used VPNs and regular users that use network resources. That's what I have for AAA if you want to find more information about it go to Cisco.com and like always I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea for any ICND1 or ICND2 material let me know by issuing a comment below.\nRelated Articles Cisco IOS Routers: Auto Secure (systemstechblog.wordpress.com) Best Practices for Securing Identity and Managing Access (brighthub.com) ","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/29/understanding-aaa/","section":"post","tags":["AAA","Access control","Accounting","Authentication","Authorization","CCNA","CCNA Security","Cisco","cisco","computers","General","IP address","networking","networks","RADIUS","router","Security","security","software","TACACS","technology","User (computing)"],"title":"Understanding AAA"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/user-computing/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"User (computing)"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco-sdm/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cisco SDM"},{"body":"So for today's post let's learn how to configure a site-to-site VPN on a router using the Cisco SDM (Security Device Manger). The Cisco SDM is a Web-based device management tool a GUI for Cisco routers this can simplify router deployments and cut ownership costs. (See the post Configuring SDM) Let's start configuring a site-to-site VPN with SDM! This tutorial is assuming that the configurations to set up Cisco SDM have already been completed. For this tutorial all we want to focus on is configuring the VPN. Since this using Cisco SDM the VPN wizard is pretty simple to understand. Before we get started however I like to have the Cisco SDM preview the commands before I deliver them to the router. To do that at the top of the menu bar click Edit and select Preferences a new window will appear (Like below) and verify that the Preview commands before delivering to the router is checked. Preview_Commands Once Cisco SDM is opened click on the configure button at the top of the SDM screen and select the VPN button on the left hand side under Tasks. Under the VPN folder select the Site-to-Site VPN. You now have two choices, for this tutorial we are using the first option. (Create a Site to Site VPN) Once you have selected your option select the Launch the selected task to begin the wizard. VPN Page A new window will open (Site-to-Site VPN Wizard) this welcome page will introduce you the settings you can choose. The quick setup will ask for minimal information when configuring the router. You can also view defaults the quick setup will attempt to deliver to the router by selecting the View Defaults button. There is also a Step by step wizard which allows more flexible options. (For this tutorial we are choosing the Quick setup wizard) Click Next. VPN_Wizard The next part of the wizard will show (VPN Connection Information) this screen has the following configuration options, VPN connection (which interface will have the VPN option), the peer identity, the authentication types, and the traffic that needs to be encrypted. VPN_Wizard_Connection Focusing on the VPN connection information, which interface will have the VPN? For this tutorial we selected serial 0/0. VPN_Wizard_Connection_Information If you selected the detail button, you can get additional information about the connection (interface) you selected. In this tutorial we selected serial 0/0 and clicking on the details gives us more information about the connection. VPN_Wizard_Detail Let's now focus on the Peer Identify; if you selected from the drop-down box Peer with static address this address will be the other router IP address. For this tutorial the IP address is 172.16.1.1. VPN_Wizard_Peer Focusing on the Authentication, you can have two options when using the Quick Setup wizard, pre-shared keys or Digital Certificates. (For this tutorial we are using pre-shared keys) These keys must be the same on the other end of the VPN tunnel in order for the VPN to work. VPN_Wizard_Auth Towards the bottom of the screen we have one final configuration step, the traffic to encrypt. The source traffic is the traffic that will be encrypted when it leaves the local interface, this traffic will only be encrypted when the traffic goes to the destination IP address. (For this tutorial the connection is Fast-Ethernet 0/0 and the traffic will be encrypted when the destination IP address is 192.168.3.1 with a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.) Click Next. VPN_Wizard_Traffic The next section is the summary screen for the Site-to-Site VPN configuration, here you can look over the summary to verify the configuration. Click Finish. VPN_Wizard_Summary If you've selected the option to preview commands before delivering them to the router, a final window will appear. In this window you can see the real commands the SDM program will attempt to deliver. You have the option to save the running-configuration to the startup-configuration after the commands complete. You also have the option to save the configuration as a file and finally you can deliver them to the router. VPN_Wizard_Deliver That's it! Believe it or not that's the SDM configuration for Site-to-Site VPN configuration you can get more information at Cisco's website about SDM and the configuration settings.

Before we get started I like to have the Cisco SDM preview the commands before I deliver them to the router. To do that at the top of the menu bar click Edit and select Preferences a new window will appear (Like below) and verify that the Preview commands before delivering to the router is checked. Preview_Commands Before we even jump into the IPS wizard we must verify that we have the IOS IPS signature package file and the public crypto key. If you don't have them you then must have a CCO account with Cisco to download them. Make sure that these files are available on the PC along with a TFTP server installed and running. Put or verify that the IOS IPS signature file is in the default TFTP folder (IOS-Sxxx-CLI.pkg) Remember that the X values will vary depending on the file that was download from Cisco. Also verify that the realm-cisco.pub.key.txt file is available on the computer and note its location. This file is the public key that it used by Cisco IOS IPS. Once Cisco SDM is opened click the configure button at the top of SDM screen and select Intrusion Prevention on the left hand side under Tasks. Click or verify that the Create IPS tab is selected and select the Launch IPS Rule Wizard button. If prompted for SDEE click ok.

Click Next. IPS_Wizard_Interfaces The next screen (Signature File and Public Key) wants to know the following information, the location of the signature file and the public key. IPS_Wizard_Sig_Pub_Key Focusing on the signature file first you want to specify the location where the signature file is. Click on the three dots button. IPS_Wizard_SigFile Another window will open (Specify Signature File) if the signature file is already on the routers flash memory select the first radio button, if the signature file is by URL select the correct protocol and address, you can also specify the signature file on the PC. (For this tutorial we are using the TFTP server and are specifying the signature file by URL, once the location of the file has been selected click OK. IPS_Wizard_SigFile_SP Now let's focus on the Public Key, in the name of the public key type realm-cisco.pub or relam-cisco.pub signature. Find and open the realm-cisco.pub.key.txt file and copy (Ctrl-C) the text that is between the phrase key-string and the word quit. Paste the text (key) in the key field in the Configure Key section. Click Next. IPS_Wizard_Public_Key The next section (Config Location and Category) wants you to specify where you want the IPS configuration files click on the three dots and choose your location. (For this tutorial we are using flash to store the IPS configuration) Towards the bottom of the screen the wizard wants to choose a signature category for the router.

SDM is fairly easy to set up but you still need at least some experience in the router command-line to get SDM working. This tutorial is already assuming that the Cisco SDM program has been installed on the PC. If the router has enough flash you can also install SDM on the router, but it is usually slower and does take some CPU power. My advice is to install it on the PC. To support Cisco SDM the PC must have a Pentium III or faster processor and at least 512MB of RAM. Cisco SDM also needs Java version 6 or newer installed on the PC. I have found out by personal experience that the newer versions of Java don't work nice with SDM. The Java version I would stick with when using Cisco SDM is Java version 6 Update 6. I would also suggest that the PC using SDM not be in a production environment because of the older Java version. Another thing that is often a problem when using SDM is the Java heap size or the memory Java uses, Some SDM components need at least 256MB of memory to run correctly, like the IPS (Intrusion Prevention System component) To change this find the Java application settings in the Windows Control Panel double click, Once the Java Control Panel opens click on the tab Java and under the Java Applet Runtime Settings select View. A another window will appear called Java Runtime Settings highlight the Java Runtime Parameters and type the following –Xmx256. _ Java_Control_Runtime _ With all that out-of-the-way let's set up SDM. You can do this a couple of ways like add security to the router when connecting to SDM. However this tutorial is going to focus on the required areas that are needed to get SDM working. The first thing that needs to be done is to configure at least one interface on the router that will connect to the computer with SDM installed. For this tutorial it will be Fast-Ethernet 0/0 and the IP address is 192.168.5.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (Here is the configuration from the router) [code]Router\u0026gt;enable Router#configure terminal Router(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/0 Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.0 Router(config-if)#no shut Router(config-if)#exit[/code] Once the computer and the router are connected to the same network, issue a ping command from the command-line of the PC. The pings should be successful. The last command that is required for SDM to work, is to turn on the HTTP server on the router. All other commands like a secure password, AAA, are encouraged but not required for SDM to work. [code]Router(config)#ip http server[/code] Once you have at least the above commands set up launch the SDM program from the computer. The SDM program will want the router's IP address. (For this tutorial the routers IP address is 192.168.5.1 and HTTPS is not enabled) If you configured the HTTPS server on the router then select the check box saying \u0026quot;This device has HTTPS enabled and I want to use it\u0026quot;. Otherwise select the Launch button. SDM Launch If no problems occur a couple of things will been showing up on the screen the first thing you will notice is that Internet Explorer will open and screen like below will appear. Although you can close this one, I like to keep these windows open when working with SDM. 1st SDM The next screen is the SDM Launch Page and like it says another window will open along with reminding you not to close this window until you are done with Cisco SDM. SDM Lanuch The next window will open and you will see a status box. This will be looking at the router platform and running configuration and loading the required information for SDM to work. SDM Stat After the status box is done, it will close and you now have the Cisco SDM \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot; page loaded and are ready to start configuring or monitoring your router with a GUI interface. SDM Main That's it! You can find more information at Cisco.com and although SDM is being phased out with the new Cisco Configuration Professional program they both have the same goal to manage a Cisco device with a GUI interface.

Yes there is an actual process that every technician should be aware of. You can also use this troubleshooting process at home, you may not know how to fix it but at least you know where the issue is and find someone who can. Before we begin if you haven't seen yet, let me introduce to you the troubleshooting process:\nYou want to gather information about the problem. (What happened?) Keep it simple, verify the obvious issues FIRST! (Is the device powered on?) Try some quick solutions first (restart, reinstall, verify connections) Gather information from the device (Device Manger, if you are in routers or switches use \u0026quot;Show\u0026quot; commands and \u0026quot;Debug\u0026quot; commands) Use your research skills! Evaluate the problem and try possible solutions. (Internet searches, Online Forums, past experiences etc.) Finally keep note of what you did even if you did not fix the issue. (Keep an engineer notebook!) This may look simple, and it is! This is the exact method I use when troubleshooting a problem. Troubleshooting is a hard skill to have, as you really can't learn from it in a book. You have to have experience with the type of technology you're working with. One thing I use all the time is my research skills this can be a life saver if you know what to look for, use key details! The internet can be helpful but putting generic terms like \u0026quot;windows XP is not working\u0026quot; will not help you but instead waste your time. Use the key terms when have an issue like an error code, type the error message, describe what you can't do, etc. Chances are somebody somewhere has had the same problem or at least something like it and decided to post it. Another thing I like to do when checking on a problem is going to the source! Although there are helpful places around web like forums, and chat systems I usually use this last. If I am having a problem with Windows for example I'll go to Microsoft Support. Same thing if I have an issue with a Cisco product I'll go to Cisco's Support webpage before I go and search my problem around the web. Finally remember ask other technicians if they have seen the problem. By using these steps and guidelines will be able to become better at troubleshooting like before it's something you can't learn from a book you must have experience with technology before you can even start troubleshooting. My last word of advice is keeping a record! Write down the steps you did, why did them and what where the solutions to the problem? If you couldn't figure it still write it down. That way if the issue occurs again you and other people know exactly how to fix the problem or also know what solutions not work last time and not waste any of your time, like always I hope this information was informative and if you have an idea about the next ICND1 or ICND2 topic comment below.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/15/troubleshooting-process/","section":"post","tags":["CCENT","Cisco Troubleshooting","computers","Debugging","FAQs Help and Tutorials","General","Hardware","ICND1","Information","networking","Operating system","operating systems","PC Hardware","Software","software","technology","Troubleshoot","Troubleshooting","tutorial","Tutorials"],"title":"Troubleshooting Process"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ccip/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"CCIP"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cisco-labs/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cisco Labs"},{"body":"Yesterday was kind of exciting at least for me when I got an e-mail in the morning about Cisco Learning Labs. Studying for the CCNA, CCNP or CCIP is in itself changeling, but getting that hands-on experience is a another problem! When money is short that last thing you want to do is spend it on routers and switches, and most of them on eBay are used and the risk of failing devices makes it a scary choice. The Cisco Learning Labs which started yesterday runs the Cisco IOS software on UNIX, this makes it a real configuration and provides people the ability to use the Cisco IOS software on their PC with an internet connection. What it the difference between simulators like Packet Tracer and GNS3? We know that Packet Tracer does not support all the commands, but is enough for the Cisco Networking Academy. Packet Tracer does a great job, but if you ever wanted to really explore the router or switch you will need to have access to real equipment. GNS3 does an excellent job for routers but fails on switches and takes some CPU power. You also need the real Cisco IOS and the only \u0026quot;legal\u0026quot; way to get one is from the router that you bought. Cisco Learning Labs have multiple labs that are available when you buy a lab bundle; these labs are available for 90 days and up to 25 hours whichever comes first. The timer only counts down when you actually use it by signing in. You can also buy more lab time in increments of five hours. Currently the Cisco Learning Labs support the following Cisco Certifications:\nCCNA/ICND2 Virtualized Lab for $50 CCNP ROUTE/SWITCH/TSHOOT (each $75) CCIP and MPLS for $75 For more information I recommend you check out www.cisco.com/go/learninglabs [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4UjuklvAiw] Comments: Configure Cisco SDM | Cisco Skills - Apr 1, 2011\n[...] Cisco Learning Labs is Live!

(See the post Basic Wireless Concepts) So let's end the discussion and talk about the 802.11n standard! You could say that the 802.11n standard is the best of both worlds in the 802.11 wireless standards. 802.11n was officially released in October of 2009 and can run in the 2.4GHz range and use the 5GHz range. Something that is special in the 802.11n standard is the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). MIMO is a technology which uses multiple antennas to gather more information essentially. It uses SDM Spatial Division Multiplexing to significantly increase the data throughput. Because of this technology 802.11n can in theory transfer speeds up to 300 Mbps. 802.11n is also backwards compatible like the 802.11g standard it can also work with the 802.11b standard. 802.11n can also work with the 802.11a standard in the 5GHz range. Currently 802.11n is the fastest and has the longest range compared to the earlier 802.11 standards. 802.11n indoors has a range of about 230 feet, in outdoor environments the 802.11n has range of about 800 feet. We all know technology changes and a while ago I posted about the 802.11ac standard which does have the potential to travel in speeds up to 1Gbps! (See the post 802.11ac Standard) For now that's my summary version of the 802.11n standard, like always I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/04/11/802.11n/","section":"post","tags":["802.11","802.11n","CCENT","CCNA","Cisco","cisco","computers","General","ICND1","ICND2","IEEE 802.11","IEEE 802.11a-1999","IEEE 802.11b-1999","IEEE 802.11g-2003","IEEE 802.11n-2009","Internet","ISM band","MIMO","networking","technology","wireless"],"title":"802.11n"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ieee-802.11/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IEEE 802.11"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ieee-802.11a-1999/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IEEE 802.11a-1999"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ieee-802.11b-1999/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IEEE 802.11b-1999"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ieee-802.11g-2003/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IEEE 802.11g-2003"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ieee-802.11n-2009/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IEEE 802.11n-2009"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ism-band/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ISM band"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/mimo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"MIMO"},{"body":"Well again we are continuing the discussion about the wireless standards. Yesterday I talked about 802.11b (See the post 802.11b), and before that I talked about 802.11a,(See the post 802.11a) I even talked about the 802.11 –Legacy (See the post 802.11 –Legacy) and in the beginning of the week I talked about the basic wireless concepts. (See the post Basic Wireless Standards) So on this Friday let's talk about the 802.11g standard! The 802.11g standard was ratified in June of 2003, and like 802.11b it operates in the 2.4GHz range. Also just like the 802.11b standard other devices that run in 2.4GHz range like cordless phones, microwaves can cause interference with the wireless signal. The 802.11g can work in two encoding classes, the Direct Sequence Spectrum (DSSS) which is like the 802.11b standard it does have benefits of resistance to jamming, you could share the signal channel among other users, it reduced the signal and noise level which helped in interception. In addition to DSSS the 802.11g standard can also use the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) which does have an advantage to still operate under severe channel conditions, like attenuation, and interference. The maximum data rate in theory is 54 Mbit/s this speed is exactly what the 802.11a standard gets. Another benefit of the 802.11g is the fact it is backwards compatible to the 802.11b standard. So in your wireless network you could have a mix of wireless standards 802.11b and 802.11g. However this does add some latency in your network and can slow it down. Because the 802.11g is backwards compatible the standard was rapidly adopted by manufactures and consumers. But this does have its drawbacks because like the 802.11b standard, 802.11g only has three channels that don't overlap and it is best practice not to have these channels overlap. That's it for this summary of the 802.11g standard, check back on Monday and I'll have the 802.11n standard posted. Like always I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.

Yesterday's post we talked about the 802.11a standard. (See the post 802.11a) We also we talked about the 802.11 – Legacy standard (See the post 802.11 – Legacy) and in the beginning of the week I went over some Basic Wireless Concepts (See the post Basic Wireless Concepts) So now that we are up to speed lets learn about the 802.11b standard. The 802.11b standard was developed the same time 802.11a went out, which was in 1999. Some key differences are that 802.11b works in the 2.4GHz range and only has a maximum bandwidth of 11 (Mbit/s). Along with only using the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) Like in the 802.11 – Legacy the DSSS had the benefits of Resistance to jamming, you could share the signal channel among other users, it reduced the signal and noise level which helped in interception. Since the 802.11b standard is in the 2.4GHz range there are only three out of the eleven channels that don't overlap. Also remember that there are other devices that use the 2.4GHz range so 802.11b devices can suffer interference from other products, like cordless phones, microwaves, etc. 802.11b products were on the market pretty quickly in early 2000 because of the cheap material to make them and the wide acceptance of the product/standard. That's it for today, check back tomorrow and I'll be posting about the 802.11g standard. Like before I hope this information was informative and let me know if you have any ideas on the next topic that deal with either ICND1 or ICND2.

On Monday I talked about the Basic Wireless Concepts (See the post Basic Wireless Concepts) in that post I mentioned the wireless standards but did not go further into detail. This post will be going over the second standard 802.11a out of the five standards that make up the 802.11. The 802.11a was published in 1999 and operates in the 5GHz band instead of the 2.4GHz band because of this 802.11a uses only the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) which does have an advantage to still operate under severe channel conditions, like attenuation, and interference. The 802.11a in theory has maximum raw data rate of 54Mbit/s however because of the varied conditions you should expect 802.11a to have a maximum speed around 20Mbit/s. What is different between the 802.11a and other 802.11 standards is the fact that the 802.11a standard has 12 channels that are not overlapping each other. Since the 802.11a standard only operates in the 5GHz band it does not get has much interference compared to the 2.4GHz range. That's it for this summary for the 802.11a standard.

This post one of the five standards that make up the 802.11. The 802.11 – Legacy has its called now and is not in use anymore by manufactures and is now obsolete was the first wireless standard available for consumer laptops. When the 802.11 - Legacy came out in 1997 you could expect speeds up to 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s) This standard was replaced quickly when 802.11b was released. The legacy standard range was about 70 feet indoors and around 330 feet outdoors at the time that was huge! Currently the 802.11 legacy standard is the only standard that used the Frequency-hopping spread spectrum. What this means is the device would switch frequencies to a different channel at random. This helped the signals become harder to intercept. The obsolete standard also could use the Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) which had the benefits of Resistance to jamming, you could share the signal channel among other users, it reduced the signal and noise level which helped in interception. Although this standard is not in use anymore you could say that the wireless explosion was on the way and this is what started it. Check back tomorrow and I'll be posting the 802.11a standard.

What is also amazing is it will continue to change and become easier for employees to get work done, with their phone, tablet, and laptop computer. But what makes this possible? What is the underlying component? The internet is becoming more available in more locations, coffee shops, airports, and your cell phone service provider, with 3G and 4G speeds. Along with the United States of America which is also moving forward with the National Broadband Plan. So today let's explore the wireless concepts! Wireless can be a scary as you can't control it. The signal is transmitted in radio waves and if set up insecurely the WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) can easily be your weakest link compared to Ethernet LANs. There are four organizations that deal with the wireless standards and products:\nIEEE develops the wireless standards (802.11) The IEEE also develops other standards as well. ITU-R is the worldwide standardization and communications that use and assign different frequencies. This helps you as a consumer if you moved/travel around the world. You are still able to use the 802.11 standard worldwide. Without the need of different devices. Wi-Fi Alliance is an industry that is worldwide that encourages interoperability of products that use WLAN standards to be certified under the Wi-Fi Alliance program. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the U.S government agency that regulates the usage of various communication frequencies in the U.S. Currently there are several wireless standards within the 802.11 standard: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n At least for today this post won't be going over these standards. There is also encryption and security which in not covered in today's post but will be covered later on. The wireless 802.11 standard can run in two modes:\nAd Hoc which uses the independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) this allows more than two devices to communicate directly with no access point needed or network needed. Infrastructure mode which uses either Basic Service Set (BSS) which uses a single wireless LAN created by one access point and all devices use that access point. Or Extended Service Set (ESS) which uses multiple access points to create one wireless LAN, this allows devices to roam between access points and this covers a larger area compared to the BSS. This is an example of an Ad Hoc network, notice how there is no access point or router/network needed. Ad Hoc This is an example of an infrastructure mode that uses BSS. Notice how there can only be one access point if you are using the BSS service set. BSS This is an example of an infrastructure mode that uses ESS. Notice how multiple access points can be configured to allow roaming and a lager coverage area. ESS Remember that when using wireless it uses the CSMA/CA algorithm the devices must listen to make sure that nobody is transmitting. It will then set a random timer to reduce the change of a collision, when the timer expires the device will listen again, if there is nobody transmitting the device will send the frame. When the frame is sent the device will listen of an acknowledgment from the access point, if no acknowledgment is received then the device will resend the frame but use the CSMA/CA logic. That's it! At least for now check back later and I'll talk about the different standards of 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n. I will also go over encryption and some best security practices for wireless LAN networks.

By creating a VLAN you are separating the network, why would you do this? There are some several reasons, like separating your production network from a guest network, and separating a test environment from a production network. This all adds security to your network. You can separate core critical network components from the rest of the production network for added security, easier troubleshooting along with separating or segmenting your network. This is breaking up the broadcast domains into smaller chucks, which will improve your network performance. Let's get started! By default if no configuration is applied to a switch, you just turned it on and plugged in networking devices, all of them are in a VLAN already, called VLAN 1. This is great if you know nothing about switch configuration and want something that works out of the box. But this also provides a security risk and if enough devices are connected this will slow down your network performance. VLANs separate the network so in order for VLANs to communicate a layer three device (router) is needed in order for VLAN communication. When you dive into VLANs there is a lot of information! For this tutorial we are just going to be creating a VLAN and that's it. So let's create a VLAN on a single switch.\nFor this tutorial we are going to put the ports fa0/1 – 10 into an access mode Then apply a VLAN 2 on ports fa0/1 – 10. (Sample Output) [code] Switch\u0026gt;enable Switch#configure terminal Switch(config)#interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 10 Switch(config-if-range)#switchport mode access Switch(config-if-range)#switchport access vlan 2 %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface Vlan2, changed state to up % Access VLAN does not exist.

A named VLAN helps us remember what the purpose of that VLAN does. The steps are almost the same here is the following, you could also change VLAN 2 into a named VLAN as well by doing lines 3 and 6.\nFor this tutorial we are going to put ports fa0/11 -20 into access mode. Then apply a name VLAN called Support on ports fa0/11 – 20. (Sample Output) [code] Switch(config)#interface vlan 3 Switch(config-if)#exit Switch(config)#vlan 3 %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface Vlan3, changed state to up Switch(config-vlan)#name Support Switch(config-vlan)#exit Switch(config)#interface range fa0/11 - 20 Switch(config-if-range)#switchport mode access Switch(config-if-range)#switchport access vlan 3 Switch(config-if-range)#exit Switch(config)#exit[/code] If we issue the command show vlan in privilege EXEC mode we can see that VLAN 3 (Support) has been created and the interfaces VLAN 3 (Support) is configured to.

If we connected PCs to these three different VLANs none of them would be able to communicate, because each VLAN is like a different network. So you would need to configure a router in order for inter-vlan commutation to work also called router on a stick.

Port security is one of the first things you can do to keep your network secure from unauthorized access. Port security can restrict devices so only devices you allow are granted access to network resources. If and when an unauthorized device is connected to a port you can decide what you want the switch to do. Let's get started! There are three different settings you can configure with port security:\nProtect which discards the traffic but keeps the port up and does not send a SNMP message. Restrict which discards the traffic and sends a SNMP message but keeps the port up Shutdown which discards the traffic sends a SNMP message and disables the port. (This is the default behavior is no setting is specified. Before setting up port security some steps need to be completed before we can set it up correctly:\nMust make the switch interface an access interface by using the switchport mode access command. This can be applied in a range of the interfaces on a switch or individual interfaces. You must enable port security by using the switchport port-security command. This can be applied in a range of the interfaces on a switch or individual interfaces. This step is optional, but you can specify how many MAC addresses the switch can have on one interface at a time. If this setting is not applied the default of one MAC address is used. The command to configure this is as follows, swithcport port-security maximum X (where X can be from 1 to 6272) Keep in mind the range the number of maximum MAC address depends on the hardware and Cisco IOS you use. This step is optional, but you can define the action to take when a violation occurs on that interface or interfaces. The default is to shut down the interface or interfaces. The command to configure this is as follows switch port-security violation { protect | restrict | shutdown }. You can specify the MAC address that is allowed to access the network resources manually by using the command switchport port-security mac-address value of MAC address. Use this command multiple times if you want more than one MAC address. If you want to be lazy and not enter every single MAC address in your organization then you can have the switch learn the MAC address by learning it with the sticky command. You would use this command as follows switchport port-security mac-address sticky. This will learn the first MAC address that comes into on the interface or interfaces. The below output is an example of configuring port security on a range of ports fa0/1 - 10, for this example the maximum MAC addresses I want on one port is two, I also want the violation to change from the default setting to restrict. Finally instead of manually configuring the ports with a MAC addresses I am going to have the switch learn them with the sticky command. [code]Switch\u0026gt;enable Switch#configure terminal Switch(config)#interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 10 Switch(config-if-range)#switchport port-security maximum 2 Switch(config-if-range)#switchport port-security violation restrict Switch(config-if-range)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky Switch(config-if-range)#exit Switch(config)#exit Switch# %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console[/code] That's it! Port security is a good step in keeping only authorized devices connected to the network, but keep in mind there are plenty more security options that need to be taken into consideration. To find more information about port security like a web search will do, along with checking with Cisco documentation at Cisco.com. I hope this tutorial is helpful and please comment below for suggestions.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/31/configuring-port-security/","section":"post","tags":["Access control","Catalyst switch","CCENT","CCNA","CCNA Security","Cisco","cisco","Cisco IOS","ICND1","ICND2","MAC address","networking","Port security","router","security","software","technology","tutorial","Tutorials"],"title":"Configuring Port Security"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/port-security/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Port security"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/broadcast-domain/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Broadcast domain"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/broadcast-domains/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Broadcast Domains"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/collision-domains/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Collision Domains"},{"body":"These different types of domains mean different things and when designing a LAN both of these domains can harm the performance of your network. If you are not aware of the difference between these two, this tutorial should help you out. If you have a small network at your home there is usually the router/modem that is connected via phone line or cable to the ISP that router/modem is then connected to a switch or they even have a switch built into the device. You connect a few cables turn on some devices and you now have an internet connection ready to go. In larger networks you have more choices that need to looked at. For example when to use a hub, a switch, or a router and how much money do you want to spend? Usually the more money spent you get more ports, performance increases and more features are added. These are all types of components that need to be thought of when designing a LAN. This tutorial is going to be focusing on two major things collision domains and broadcast domains.\nThe definition of a collision domain is a set of LAN devices whose frames could collide with one another. This happens with hubs, bridges, repeaters and wireless access points as only one device can send and receive. If more than one device tries sending or receiving, the information is lost and irrecoverable it will need to be resent. This can slow down network performance along with making it a security threat.\nA hub is considered a layer one device of the OSI model; all it does is send frames out on all ports including the port in which the frame was received on. This causes a collision domain because only one device can send at the same time. This also shares the bandwidth between of all devices connected to that collision domain. These devices can inefficiently use that bandwidth because of the CSMA/CD and jamming signals that occur when a collision happens. A switch uses layer two of the OSI model, so the switch uses MAC addresses to send frames to the correct device. Rather than sending it to all ports a switch only sends the frame out one port, if it has the MAC address in its MAC address table. If not the switch will send the frame on all ports except for the port in which the frame was received on. Switches provide separate collision domains on each port, this provides dedicated bandwidth to that device and allows simultaneous conversations between devices on different ports. Each port can be operated at full-duplex so the device can send and receive information at the same time.\nA broadcast domain is like a collision domain, however the difference is these broadcast domains belong to a set of devices in the same layer two domain. These kind of blur together between a layer three broadcast message and a layer two broadcast message (FFFF:FFFF:FFFF). A layer two broadcast goes to every host in the same LAN/VLAN.\nTo make it little more fun there are two types of layer three broadcast messages :)\nLimited/Local Broadcast - (255.255.255.255) is often used when the host really has no idea what network its on and waits for a DHCP server to respond back. As well as if a host needs to know the MAC address of a another host on the same LAN/VLAN. This broadcast goes to every host on the same LAN/VLAN and is the most common type of broadcast message.\nDirected Broadcast - Is a directed IP packet whose destination is a valid broadcast address on the network that the host is not currently a part of. A router would forward this on to the correct network, however this is usually disabled by default. Example 192.168.1.255/24 Also keep in mind when you send a layer three broadcast you'll also send a layer two broadcast regardless of what type of layer three broadcast message is sent. This also works the other way, when you send a layer two broadcast message you'll also send a layer three broadcast message. (We work up and down the OSI model)\nIf devices are in the same IP network they will send and receive a broadcast messages and having a smaller broadcast domains can improve network performance as well as improve against security attacks. The more PCs and network devices connected to a single broadcast domain, the more broadcast messages you will have. A broadcast message goes to every PC that's on the LAN/VLAN. An example is when the router gets a packet from a different network and that packet is destined to host (192.168.1.124) it will send the packet if the router has the MAC address of 192.168.1.124. If the router does not have the MAC address of (192.168.1.124) in its MAC address table it will send an ARP (Limited/Local Broadcast) request before delivering the packet.\nIn this ARP request the router is basically saying who is 192.168.1.124? and tell me your MAC address. That broadcast message goes to every PC and network device in the broadcast domain. Each PC and network device that is in the 192.168.1.0/24 network has to look at the frame and then discard it if it's not 192.168.1.124. The PC that is 192.168.1.124 will respond back to the ARP request with an ARP reply. So a broadcast message can just be like a collision domain and affect network performance. To find more information about collision domains and broadcast domains do a simple web search, you will find a lot of information. You can also go to the Cisco Learning Network to find that and more information about the networking world. I hope this tutorial was helpful.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/30/collision-domains-vs-broadcast-domains/","section":"post","tags":["Broadcast domain","Broadcast Domains","CCENT","CCNA","Cisco","cisco","Collision Domains","Data Communications","ICND1","ICND2","Internet","MAC address","Network performance","networking","technology","tutorial"],"title":"Collision Domains vs Broadcast Domains"},{"body":"Today this tutorial is going be talking about how to configure SSH on a Cisco router or switch. SSH or Secure Shell encrypts the data that is sent from the terminal application to the device. Making if far more safer when it is compared to telnet which sends the data in plain text. To add support for SSH to a Cisco router or switch, the device needs some added information then just passwords. The device will need a username and password, this can be configured on a AAA server (Authentication Authorization and Accounting) or on the device locally this tutorial will focus on locally configured usernames and passwords. To set up SSH you need to configure that following information for the purpose of this tutorial the username will be ciscoskills and the password will be cisco.\nThe first thing you need to do is change the vty lines in the device (router/switch) depending on the device you will have more vty lines. This command will check its local database for usernames and passwords. The command is entered under (config-line)# prompt with login local. The next step depends if you want to still allow telnet connections to the device (router/switch). This command is entered under (config-line)# prompt which is transport input telnet ssh. If you only want ssh connections then type the following in transport input ssh. You must enter an at least one username and password for the device (router/switch). This command is entered in global configuration mode (config)# which for this example the username will be ciscoskills and the password will be cisco. The command would be username ciscoskills password cisco in global configuration mode. You also must configure a DNS domain name for this example the domain will be ciscoskills.net. This command is entered in global configuration mode (config)# which for this example is ip domain-name ciscoskills.net. The final command to configure SSH is generate a key pair, This command Is entered in global configuration mode (config)# which is crypto key generate rsa. When asked the question how many bits in the modulus? Cisco documentation likes 1024. The more bits you have the longer the key and harder to crack. The default is 512, and probaly best to go for 2048. This is what the follow commands would look like in the below output:\n1Router_or_Switch# 2Router_or_Switch#configure terminal 3Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. 4Router_or_Switch(config)#line vty 0 4 5Router_or_Switch(config-line)#login local 6Router_or_Switch(config-line)#transport input telnet ssh 7Router_or_Switch(config-line)#exit 8Router_or_Switch(config)#username ciscoskills\u0026amp;nbsp;password cisco 9Router_or_Switch(config)#ip domain-name ciscoskills.net 10Router_or_Switch(config)#crypto key generate rsa 11The name for the keys will be: Router_or_Switch.ciscoskills.net 12Choose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to 2048 for your 13General Purpose Keys.

UDP is the total opposite of the TCP communication. UDP in short sends information or data without notifying the receiver that its sending data. UDP is considered a connectionless protocol, and does not guarantee the reliability or order the packets like TCP does. Therefor packets may be dropped and are never recovered.\nAlthough this may sound like a bad thing, it depends on your network application. Some common network applications that use UDP include: the Domain Name System (DNS), streaming media applications such as IPTV, Voice over IP (VoIP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and online games. Looking at the UDP header there is a lot less overhead when compared to TCP, this makes UDP faster for routers to route the information with less overhead on processing power.\nTime-sensitive applications often use UDP because if dropped packets means less delayed information then UDP it is. In connectionless protocols there is no effort made to set up a connection like TCP, UDP just sends the information in one direction from the source address to the destination address and hopes it arrives in complete package but if not, the protocol does not care. So to review:\nUDP is Unreliable - When a message is sent, it cannot or will not know if it will reach its destination; it could get lost along the way. There is no concept of acknowledgment, re-transmission and or timeout like the TCP protocol. UDP is not ordered - If two messages are sent to the same destination, the order in which they arrive cannot be predicted. UDP is lightweight - There is no ordering of messages, any tracking connections, etc. It is a small transport layer designed on top of IP. Inside UDP Datagrams - Packets that are sent individually and are guaranteed to be whole if they arrive. Packets have definite bounds and do not split or merge into data streams. (Meaning that UDP packets are not coherent) That's UDP is in a summary format, I hope this information is useful and like always look at other sources like Cisco.com or do a simple web search. Comments are encourage, so let me know how I'm doing if you have a topic that is related to the ICND1 or ICND2 let me know about.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/28/understanding-udp/","section":"post","tags":["CCENT","CCNA","cisco","computers","ICND1","ICND2","Internet","Internet Protocol","IP address","networking","Packet","Protocols","technology","Transmission Control Protocol","Transmission Protocols","Trivial File Transfer Protocol","User Datagram Protocol"],"title":"Understanding UDP"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/user-datagram-protocol/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"User Datagram Protocol"},{"body":"Well my first of the many Cisco certifications that I plan take in the future was a success! I was able to pass the ICND1 exam. This blog post is going to be a little different in that I want to share how I was able to pass this test and talk about my experience.\nWell in January after finishing the Cisco Networking Academy in the Exploration series I wanted to go ahead and take shot at the ICND1 exam. Now I knew that this was not going to be easy, by looking at online sites like CLN (Cisco Learning Network) and reading the horror stories of people missing by one point, having a hard time understanding the material, not fully prepared, etc. But also reading success stories about how people passed and what they did to pass, really made me jump on the opportunity. Another thing that made me want to try it was the discounted price I was able to get, by going into the Cisco Networking Academy and doing fairly well I was able to apply for a voucher, which helped that determination I had when studying for the ICND1 exam.\nSo what did I do to pass this this exam? Well although I finished the Cisco Networking Academy I needed to review the fundamental topics again. So I bought the CCNA Official Exam Certification Library (Exam 640-802), Third Edition (Containing ICND1 and ICND2 Second Edition Exam Certification Guides) I wanted something that really covered it all in one book, and I am very pleased that I went ahead and got it. But reading a book I don't think cuts it, you need to fully understand how to set up routers, and switches. That's where either packet tracer or access to physical equipment comes in. Since I am part of the Cisco Networking Academy I had access to physical and simulation software that I could use. One thing I can agree on is with Cisco exams you want to make sure that you know how a set of commands work and know what they do and when to apply them.\nSo how did I study and how long did it take me to study? Well at first I wanted to study alone I felt that I could get more done. However if possible I would suggest finding a friend that also wants to get certified or at least someone who you can teach the material to. I think I learned a lot more and having discussions with each other and it helped both of us understand the material. For the ICND1 exam it took three months of us studying and preparing for the exam. We mainly used the book from Wendell Odom and did some web searches for ICND1 practice questions. Another thing that helped me was joining the Cisco Learning Network. By asking and answering questions on the discussion pages.\nHow can I pass the ICND1 exam? Make sure you know the material. Its sounds simple but when I was taking the exam the questions I was given were questions that I would've failed if I hadn't went over the book, online practice questions, and discussions. I felt confident in my answers, I was not second guessing myself and I knew the material inside and out. Another thing I did before taking the exam was go over the ICND1 exam topics. I made sure I could explain every topic that was listed. In the end it shows as at the end of the exam I received an excellent score! Having said that there is always someone who wants the easy route and one thing I can say that won't help you is a thing called brain dumps. Which are questions that a person would memorize and some if not all are taken from the official exams. In addition you are violating the non-disclosure agreements. I don't understand why people would do this type of thing. To me it sounds like more work than to really just understand the material. It degrades the certification and really does not help anyone. So my advice is don't pay that amount of money because usually they are about has much as the official exam.\nThis is my first time taking the exam what can I expect? Like you I was nervous so nervous, I reviewed and reviewed and went over everything again and again. I would agree to this which is you are battling with yourself. Relaxing is important and one thing I like when taking the Cisco exams is you start with a tutorial, I think this helps you get into the mode and you start to calm down. You have about 15 minutes to just breathe and get ready to take the exam and don't over think it! Simple questions usually want a simple answer. Although test taking tips help you have to know the material in the end to pass, you can't guess at this stuff. Set a goal and take the exam. Looking back I'm glad I did. It showed that I'm in right the career path and shows to employers that I know the material.\nSo what's next well I'm taking a break this week, and will start again next week with some more Cisco information and tutorials. I'm also going to start reviewing the ICND2 exam soon and currently I'm estimating that this one will take longer than three months. :)\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/21/how-i-passed-the-icnd1-exam/","section":"post","tags":["CCENT","Certification","Cisco","Cisco Career Certifications","Cisco Networking Academy","Education","ICND1","networking","Life","technology"],"title":"How I passed the ICND1 Exam"},{"body":"Earlier we talked about using CBAC (See the post Understanding CBAC) the \u0026quot;classic firewall\u0026quot; and we mention some information about zone based firewalls but not nearly enough. So today we will be talking about zone based firewalls. Why are they different? We also will learn the basics about what is zone based and what are the advantages compared to CBAC. You can think of zone based has making interfaces in a quarantine zone, each interface by default if set up in a zone is denied access to any other interface. This helps isolate networks that have private and or secure information that does not need the public network to have access to it. The firewall policies are configured using the Cisco Common Classification Policy Language (C3PL), this uses a hierarchical structure to define network protocol inspection and allows network devices to be grouped under one inspection policy. Believe it or not it should be easier to configure zone based firewall compared to CBAC Remember that CBAC has these limitations:\nBy having multiple inspection policies and ACLs on several interfaces on a router makes it difficult and sometimes overwhelming. All traffic through a given interface is subject to the same inspection. CBAC relies too heavily on ACLs, which can only do so much! By using zones that borders a network the traffic is inspected by the policy restrictions. These restrictions can be different in each zone or interface. Using the zone based approach does have its benefits:\nThe Zone Based firewall is not dependent on ACLs. The router security posture is to block unless explicitly allowed. CBAC allows everything unless explicitly denied or checked. Policies are easy to read and troubleshoot with C3PL. (Cisco Common Classification Policy Language) One policy affects any given traffic, instead of needing multiple ACLs, inspection actions and rules that CBAC would need. An important note when deciding to implement CBAC or Zone based is that either models can be enabled on the router simultaneously. They however cannot be used on the same interface as a router. There are three actions the zone based firewall can take when looking at traffic:\nInspect - This action is like the CBAC ip inspect command. It automatically allows for return traffic and potential ICMP messages. For protocols requiring multiple parallel signaling and data sessions (such as, FTP or H.323), the inspect action also handles the proper establishment of data sessions. Drop - To a deny statement in an ACL. A log option is also available to log the rejected packets. Pass - To a permit statement in an ACL. The pass action does not track the state of connections or sessions within the traffic. Pass allows the traffic only in one direction. A corresponding policy must be applied to allow return traffic to pass in the opposite direction. When determining how to set up zone-based firewalls the first thing you need to think of is the different zones that need to be implemented. The infrastructure must be split into separate zones with different security levels. Example the public network or internet to the inside network would be split into two zones. Create the zones for the firewall with the zone security command. zone-based You also have to set up policies between the zones. Remember by default when zones are configured they deny all access to any other zone as well has non-zone interfaces. You must define the type of traffic that will be allowed on the zone. Example would be TCP and UDP sessions which are the most common, but there is also ICMP and others that can be defined. You want to define the traffic classes with the class-map type inspect command. After the zones have been identified along with the traffic requirements between them, the next thing to do is design the physical infrastructure and policies this would be stating the number of devices between the mission-critical devices and least critical devices and determining redundant routes and devices if any. You would specify the firewall policies with the policy-map type inspect command. Define the class-map name and you want that policy to do? Do you want the policy to pass, inspect or drop the traffic specified by the class-map? You want to apply the firewall policies the source and destination zones, by using the zone-pair security command. What zone is the source? What zone is the destination? What policy-map are you going to use by using the service-policy type inspect command. The last setup is to identify a subset within zones and merge the traffic; the technician must identify the connected interfaces and apply that zone to the interface, by using the zone-member security command.\nTo recap, you must create a zone. Then define the type of traffic that will be checked by the policy by using the class-map type inspect command Next, is define the firewall policies by using the policy-map type inspect command. You what do you want to do with that traffic that you specified earlier with the class-maps (Pass, inspect or drop) Assign the policy-maps to the zone pairs, tell the router which policy is the source and destination by using the zone-pair security command. Tell the router which policy to use by using the service-policy type inspect command. Finally apply that zone-pair to the interface by using the zone-member security command. That is the rundown of zone-based firewalls! Look complex? If you start to understand it you will find it easier to carry out than CBAC. Zone-based helps keep interfaces apart by blocking all traffic unless allowed by the policies. Like before you can always find more information online. I recommend Cisco.com for a full understanding of zone-based policy firewall, I hope this tutorial was helpful.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/18/understanding-zone-based-firewalls/","section":"post","tags":["CCNA Security","Cisco","cisco","firewall","networking","operating systems","router","security","software","technology","tutorial","Tutorials"],"title":"Understanding Zone Based Firewalls"},{"body":"Network attacks have always been around but they are getting more advanced every day. These attacks are also easy to set up and use. In the past these types of attacks would have to be pulled off by someone who really knew about computers and to know what they are doing. That's a true hacker, now there are programs that do the same damage and sometimes more with a couple clicks of a mouse, so now anybody can bring down a network. The only thing that changes is the motivation of the person. Some People that run scripts or programs don't always know what the program does, so they click on some buttons and the program does its thing, if it fails sometimes the person stops there and gives up. But there are people who want to do some real damage to a company these people usually have organizations like the Anonymous group. So what are some of the common attacks people or organizations do? Well in a company the network administrators might focus on the outside of the network, but have their inside network unsecure or extremely weak. So if somebody on the inside was able to execute and attack it could have a huge effect on the network. So attacks that could occur:\nReconnaissance Attacks: Gather information about the network, this could be anything from ping sweeps, to port scanners, IP scanners, etc. The goal of this type of attack to gather information on the network and exploit its weak areas.\nAccess Attacks: Try to steal or attempt to steal data. Financial information, classified information, critical information and even international espionage.\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks. Which has three types of DoS types\nDestroyers: which harm computers, by erasing data and software Crashers: cause harm by causing computers to fail or causing the machine to be unable to commutate with the network or connect to the network. Flooders: Flood the network with packets to make the network unusable and preventing any useful communication making the service appear unavailable. Computer viruses are one of the many tools that could be used to carry out these types of attacks. Along with access to unsecured wireless networks. This makes the network weak if the computer or host is able to access ever device on that network. Infected laptops if the user brings the computer home from the office, that computer could get infected and exposing classified information and even have the potential to infect other computers. Employees could with or without knowing that what they download or save on USBs could cause harm to the company. A good security policy is recommended along with some helpful network access tools and components. These security tools can always stop attacks but they can slow somebody down and maybe be alerted to higher authority. Viruses are a common thing to get on a computer that is not protected with antivirus software or that virus could be a zero-day attack so the software does not have the virus in its signature database. But there are more than just viruses out there like:\nScanners: Are a tool that sends connection requests to a different TCP or UDP port, different applications. This attempt tries to discover which hosts or computers have IP services and possibly the operating system. Spyware: A virus that looks for private or sensitive information, like tracking websites the user visits. What the user does with the computer, and passing that information back to the attacker. Worm: A self-propagating program that can quickly spread and copy itself around the network or even the internet. This type of program also can do DoS attacks on servers and computers. Keystroke Loggers: A virus that logs all keystrokes, capturing your username and passwords to secure sites. Giving the attacker access to your personal information. Phishing: The attacker sets up a fake website that looks exactly like a legitimate website often from banks and or credit card companies. Sometimes the user will get an e-mail and a link to the website, the user clicks on the link and is directed to the fake website. The user then puts in login information or personal information. Giving the attack access to the user's bank or personal information Although this is brief it gives you an overview of the different types of security attacks network and host based. This can go into a lot more information and if you want to find more information about an attack and the ways to stop or slow down the attack a simple web search will be able to point you in the right direction.

Routers are used in the OSI layer three or the network layer. These routers have IP addresses and forward IP packets to the proper destination. This guide is somewhat basic and is assuming you have some information of how IP addressing works and along with what routing protocols are. So let's focus first on how a host or a computer forwards traffic and then look at how a router forwards traffic. Computers forward or send packets based on these two steps.\nIf the destination IP address is in the same network or subnet as PC-1 then send the packet directly to that host (without the routers help)\nIf PC-1 does not have the MAC address to the destination host (PC-2) then it will send an ARP request to get the MAC address. ARP-Message For example PC-1 (192.168.1.1) is trying to send to PC-2 (192.1681.2) since both of these computers are on the same network, (PC-1 checks the destination subnet mask and IP address to see if they are on the same network which they are) if PC-1 knows the MAC address of PC-2 it will put the IP address of PC-2 in the destination address field along with other information not related to this tutorial and forward the packet. If PC-1 does not know the MAC address it will send and ARP request, what this request does is send a broadcast message to all other PCs and devices connected on the 192.168.1.0 network. This message wants to find the MAC address of the host connected to 192.168.1.2, once PC-2 gets the message it will send its MAC address to PC-1. PC-1 will then forward the packet to PC-2.\nIf the destination IP address is not in the same subnet or network has PC-1 then PC-1 will send the packet to its default gateway.\nIf PC-1 does not have the MAC address to the default gateway (R1) then send a ARP request to get the MAC address For example PC-1 (192.168.1.1) is trying to send to R1 (192.168.1.254) because the packet is not in the same network, PC-1's main goal is to send to a webserver (154.63.2.1) (PC-1 checks the destination subnet mask and IP address to see if they are on the same network which they are not) if PC-1 knows the MAC address of R1 it will put the IP address of R1 in the destination address field along with other information not related to this tutorial, and forward the packet. If PC-1 does not know the MAC address it will send and ARP request, what this request does is send a broadcast message to all other PCs and devices connected on the 192.168.1.0 network. This message wants to find the MAC address of the host connected to 192.168.1.254, once R1 gets the message it will send its MAC address to PC-1. PC-1 will then forward the packet/frame. Once the frame is received by R1 the router will first check the data-link FCS field. If the frame received errors the router will drop the packet. If the frame has no errors the router will rip off the old data link header and trailer and then look at the IP packet. The router then compares the IP packet's destination address. If the router has the IP address in its routing table the router will encapsulate the IP packet inside a new data link layer header and trailer and forward it out the correct interface, thus forwarding the frame. Confusued? Let's go into some more detail of what happened. Route-Example Looking at the topology PC-1 wants to send a packet to the web server. Since the web server is not on PC-1's network it will need to send the packet to its default gateway which is R1. PC-1 will build an IP packet with the destination IP address of the web server (154.63.2.1). PC-1 sends this has an Ethernet frame with the destination IP address of R1 and has the MAC address of R1. R1 receives the frame and because the MAC address matches R1, the router will copy the frame and process it. R1 checks the FCS and no errors have occurred, next the router will then discard the old Ethernet header and trailer. R1 will compare the address and see if it has a match in its routing table; if there is not match the router will drop the frame. However the router finds an entry in its table to (154.63.2.1) the frame is forwarded out the router serial interface. The router encapsulates the packet and forwards out serial interface in an HDLC frame towards the next router. This will repeat the same steps in each router as along as the routers have a route to that destination it will then eventually be received by the router connected to the web server. This router will send an ARP message that wants to know who is 154.63.2.1? That broadcast message will be received by all devices connected to the 154.63.2.0 network. The web server will respond and send the MAC address to the router and the router will then forward the packet to the web server. That's the basic understanding of how routers forward traffic, this tutorial only scratched the surface with how routers route along with keeping it simple some things were skipped in this tutorial. If you would like to find more information take a look at Cisco.com which is a great place to get started. Questions or comments are also welcomed.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/16/how-a-router-routes/","section":"post","tags":["ARP","CCENT","CCNA","Cisco","cisco","computers","ICND1","ICND2","Internet Protocol","IP address","MAC address","networking","Protocols","router","Subnetwork","technology","tutorial","Tutorials"],"title":"How a Router Routes"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/aircrack-ng/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Aircrack-ng"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/backtrack/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"backtrack"},{"body":"BackTrack is Linux network security audit tool for security professionals. This tool is used for testing and penetrating networks. That being said** This tutorial is for educational use only. This is meant only to teach that WEP is an insecure option, and is recommend to use a harder encryption. Using this tutorial on a network that you do not have permission to access or is not yours, could be illegal! ** This was tested on BackTrack version 4 and the steps outlined in this tutorial were successful. (this tutorial is assuming that you have BackTrack 4 installed and are ready with a shell prompt) The first thing you want to do is start your wireless interface in most cases this is wlan0 [code]airmon-ng start wlan0[/code] In the output look for the monitor interface in most cases this is mon0 The next thing you want to do is copy down the target AP's ESSID, the MAC address of the AP, also copy down the channel of the target AP. [code]airodump-ng mon0[/code] There must be a client or clients using the AP if not you can't crack it. Match the MAC address of the AP to the available clients you have listed. Next only output what you want (for example I have an AP on channel 8 and that MAC address of the AP is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and it's out monitor 0) the command would be: [code]airodump-ng --channel 8 --write output --bssid 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 mon0[/code] (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is you want to associate your wireless card with the AP(for example I have the AP's MAC and ESSID (which is test) and my wireless MAC address (which is aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like: [code]aireplay-ng -1 0 -e test -a 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h aa:00:55:bb:DD:FF[/code] (Open a new shell prompt) The next step is start the packet injection (for example you will need the target AP's MAC address (which is 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 and my(yours) wireless MAC address (which is 00:55:bb:DD:FF) the command would look like: [code]aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:dd:aa:cc:88:33 -h 00:55:bb:DD:FF mon0[/code] (Open a new shell prompt) The final step depends were the outputs are saved and the name of the output (for this example they were on /root and the name of the file was output-01.cap) so the command would look like: [code]aircrack-ng output-01.cap[/code] Again this depends were the file was saved it could be in a different location. But after that command aircrack will attempt to crack the WEP key it will tell you that it either failed or if it was able to find it. (If it does fail wait for more packets and try again.) The way aircrack works is that it reads the packet injection file, (this file is continues to update as packets move across the network) aircrack then finds the common key because that key is sent back and forth in the network. Depending on how active the network is aircrack is able to find the key in less than a minute! Keep in mind when I was setting this up on a test AP I did run into some difficulties, although cracking a WEP key is relatively easy it still took me some time in troubleshooting.

This is when an employee performs his or her job away from the office, usually from their home office. By doing this it allows personal convenience, less travel to and from the workplace. At an Organization level it provides continuity of operations, Secure, reliable and manageable access to information, cost-effective integration of data, voice, video and applications. Broadband refers to advance communications systems that can offer high-speed transmission of services, such as data, voice, and video over the internet. Teleworkers require a connection to an ISP in order for VPNs to work. Some of the connections they offer are: Dialup Access: is inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. To connect to the ISP, speeds are up to 54kbps which is the slowest connection and is used in areas where higher speed options are not available. DSL: More expensive than dialup but provides a faster connection. DSL uses phone lines and provides a continuous connection. DSL speeds vary to 200kbps and higher, upload and download speeds also vary according to the user’s distance from the central office. Cable Modem: offered by cable television service providers, the signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television. A special cable modem separates the internet signal and provides an Ethernet connection to the LAN. Speeds vary between 200kbps and higher. Satellite: internet access is also offered by satellite service providers. It uses a satellite modem that transmits radio signals to the nearest POP (point of presence) Speeds vary between 128kbps to 512kbps. VPN Technology A VPN is Virtual, any information within a private network is transported over a public network (internet) Private, the traffic is heavily encrypted to keep the data confidential Instead of using dedicated Layer 2 connections like a leased line, a VPN uses virtual connections that are routed through the internet. Some Benefits of using a VPN Cost savings, Organizations can use cost-effective internet providers to connect remote offices and users to the main corporate site. Security, advanced encryption and authentication protocols protect data from unauthorized access. Scalability VPNs use the internet infrastructure within ISPs and carriers, making it easy for organizations to add new users, add large amounts of capacity without the need for significant infrastructure. The Types of VPNs Site-to-site VPNs – provide access between two physical sites to an intranet or extranet over a shared infrastructure, such as the internet. Site-to-Site VPNs are used by physical sites such as corporate offices, branch offices, and suppliers. Remote-access VPNs – give remote users access to an intranet or extranet over a shared infrastructure such as the intranet. Remote-access VPNs typically are used by teleworkers and mobile users. VPNs create a private connection or network between two endpoints and usually include authentication and encryption. VPN tunneling Tunneling uses three classes of protocols: Carrier Protocol, the protocol over which information travels (Frame Relay, ATM, MPLS) Encapsulating protocol, the protocol that is wrapped around the original data (GRP, IPsec, L2F, PPTP, L2TP) Passenger protocol, The protocol over which the original data was carried (IPX,AppleTalk, IPv4, IPv6) VPN Encryption algorithms Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm: developed by IBM, DES uses a 56-bit key, ensuring high-performance encryption. DES is a symmetric key cryptosystem. Triple DES (3DES) algorithm: A newer version of DES that encrypts with one key, decrypts with a different key, and then encrypts a final time with another key. 3DES makes the encryption process significantly stronger. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) adopted AES to replace the existing DS encryption in cryptographic devices. AES provides stronger security than DES and is computationally more efficient than 3DES. AES offers three different key lengths 128-bit,192-bit, and 256-bit keys. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA): An asymmetric key cryptosystem, the keys use a bit length of 512, 768, 1024 or larger. These technologies make it possiable to work outside of the office, but be secure has possiable. Doing a web search will also give a lot of information about VPNs and encryption.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/11/telecommuting-services/","section":"post","tags":["Advanced Encryption Standard","CCENT","CCNA","Cisco","cisco","Encryption","General","ICND1","ICND2","Internet","Internet service provider","networking","Security","security","Software","software","technology","Virtual private network"],"title":"Telecommuting Services"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/cable/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cable"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/crossover-cable/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Crossover cable"},{"body":"The EIA/TIA puts the standards in UTP cable, and when cabling a network there are two standards. T568A and T568B these standards are important when deciding to put a crossover cable or straight through cable This tutorial is going to be talking about when and where to apply these different standards. We are going to be focusing on the UTP cable and with the RJ-45 connectors; in order for the communication to work properly we need to make sure we understand where to put these cables.\nLet's first look at the RJ-45 connector, this connector has 8 pins and each copper wire.\nEach pin in the Rj-45 connector does a different thing. Although not all pins or wires are used, they provide grounding along with helping the signal from becoming weak in the cable. So for the T568A standard the colors of the UTP as follows:\nIn Pin 1: Green/White (Striped Green)\nT568A Color In Pin 2: Green (Solid Green) In Pin 3: Orange/White (Striped Orange) In Pin 4: Blue (Solid Blue) In Pin 5: Blue/White (Striped Blue) In Pin 6: Orange (Solid Orange) In Pin 7: Brown/White (Striped Brown) In Pin 8: Brown (Solid Brown) For the standard T568B the colors are almost the same but with a few differences.\nIn Pin 1: Orange/White (Striped Orange) In Pin 2: Orange (Solid Orange) In Pin 3: Green/White (Striped Green) In Pin 4: Blue (Solid Blue) In Pin 5: Blue/White (Striped Blue) In Pin 6: Green (Solid Green) In Pin 7: Brown/White (Striped Brown) In Pin 8: Brown (Solid Brown) These standards are put together for one reason, to make the data or electic signal travel up to 100 meters. Now you could make your own standard and devices would be able to communicate but not has far and it may even cause transmission errors in the cable. Who knows?\nBut for one thing it would make difficult for another person to learn your color code. So when setting up cable the first thing you need to choose is what standard to use. After you picked you standard can you just connect anything and everything with the same pin out? No! One to remember is if it's a like device now this is not always the case like a PC connected to a router would need a crossover but usually a PC to PC, or router to router, switch to switch these will always be a crossover cable.\nWhat is a crossover cable?\nThe pins in a crossover cable are switched so one end will have the either T568A or T568B and you will change the pins on the other end. So for example if we had T568A on one end of the cable you could simply put T568B on the other end or vise versa. (That's another reason they put standards in) :) For Different devices like a PC to a switch, switch to a router, etc. Will usually have a straight through cable. Meaning the pins don't change. If you have the same standard on one end of the cable keep it same on the other end. So for example if you had T568A on one side put T568A on the other side of the cable. That's that! The standards can get confusing if you over think them. There are other sites out there that go over why the different standards and why some devices send and receive on other pins. But the one thing to remember is that the colors don't really mean anything as long has the pins or pairs match with the other end. Remember this depends on the type of cable, straight through will match the pairs/pins. Crossover will mix pins 1,2,3, and 6.\nMake it a great day, today!\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/10/crossover-or-straight-through/","section":"post","tags":["Cable","CCENT","CCNA","Cisco","Crossover cable","Ethernet","Ethernet crossover cable","ICND1","ICND2","Internet","networking","Pin","RJ45","router","technology","tutorial","Tutorials"],"title":"Crossover or Straight through?"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/ethernet-crossover-cable/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Ethernet crossover cable"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/pin/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Pin"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/rj45/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"RJ45"},{"body":"There are tons of network attacks out there. Using a firewall helps but does look for signature based attacks. Access Control Lists are like firewalls and only look at the protocols like HTTP, FTP POP, etc. Cisco has developed some tools that will help network administrators combat the issue; IDS, (Intrusion Detection System) and IPS. (Intrusion Prevention System) Let's go into IDS first, Cisco IDS is a physical device and is like an alarm system it will alert you when an attack happens but that's it, the system won't block the connection. The IDS system is deployed in promiscuous mode meaning the sensor is placed where it can hear all the network traffic but is not in direct connect with the network making it an advantage when using an IDS:\nNo network impact, latency, or jitters etc. No network impact if there is a sensor failure No network impact if there is a sensor overloaded. However the IDS does have some disadvantages compared to IPS\nIf packets trigger an alarm that's all it does is tell us that an attack is happening Correct tuning is required for valid and invalid packets The company must have a well thought-out security policy Networks that are vulnerable must have evasion techniques So what can IPS do that IDS can't? Well the IPS system can alert just like IDS but the IPS system can also block the attack. Remember that the IDS system can only alert. IPS works inline with the network it is a physical device just like IDS but is directly connected to the network. So what are the advantages to IPS compared to IDS?\nStops packets that trigger an alert Can use stream normalization techniques (since the IPS sensor is inline with the traffic it can reduce many network attacks that exist. Like the IDS the IPS does have disadvantage when compared to IDS:\nSince the sensor is connected directly (inline) with the network it might affect network traffic. If the sensor is overloaded that will also impact the network. A company must have a thought-out security policy. There can be some latency, jitter etc. with the network. So why use IPS instead of IDS? Well IDS is an older technology and like mentioned before IDS only alerts you that an attack is happening, it logs the attack and that's it. Network attacks can happen fast and some of them only need a small amount of time to complete the attack. So once a network technician gets into the network equipment the attacker could be long gone and got what he/she needed. Sure you can now fix the problem but it might be little too late. IPS is able to load signature files this is like the definitions on your anti-virus software which it looks for patterns based on the attack. Which IPS can take that same style and block those attacks based on the security policies you implement, along with alerting you of what happened. That's my brief rundown of what these two technologies do there is a lot more information you will be able to find on the web. But both have their places in the networking environment and it all depends on the money the company wants to spend to keep their networks secure. You can find more information at Cisco.com and or other places, I hope this information was informative.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/09/cisco-ids-vs.-ips/","section":"post","tags":["CCNA Security","Cisco","cisco","Cisco Systems","computers","Denial-of-service attack","firewall","Hardware","Information","Intrusion Detection System","Intrusion Prevention System","Network administrator","networking","router","Security","security","Software","software","technology"],"title":"Cisco IDS vs. IPS"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/electric-charge/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Electric charge"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/laser/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Laser"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/laser-printer/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Laser printer"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/laser-printing-process/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Laser Printing Process"},{"body":"Let's move away from Cisco for at least a day, So this post will be talking about the six steps in the laser printing process, this is good for technicians who fix or repair printers along with a good learning experience. With my limited knowledge of printers I used this process to at least help diagnose the problem. If you have no idea how a printer works, I would not try to fix it. People have become hurt with these machines leave it to the professionals. Step 1: Cleaning When an image has been deposited on the paper and the drum has separated from the paper, any remaining toner must be removed from the drum. A printer may have a blade that scrapes all excess toner from the drum. Some printers use an AC voltage on a wire that removes the charge from the drum surface and allows the excess toner to fall away from the drum. The excess toner is stored in a used toner container that may be emptied or discarded. Step 2: Conditioning This step involves removing the old latent image from the drum and conditioning the drum for a new latent image. Conditioning is done by placing a special wire, grid, or roller that receives a negative charge of about – 600 volts DC uniformly across the surface of the drum. The charged wire or grid is called the primary corona. The roller is called a conditioning roller. Printing Step 3: Writing The writing process involves scanning the photosensitive drum with the laser beam. Every part of the drum that is exposed to the light has the surface charge reduced to about – 100 volts DC. This electrical charge has a lower negative charge than the remainder of the drum. As the drum turns, an invisible latent image is created on the drum. Step 4: Developing In the developing phase, the toner is applied to the latent image on the drum. The toner is a negatively-charged combination of plastic and metal particles. A control blade holds the toner at a microscopic distance from the drum. The toner then moves from the control blade to the more positively-charged latent image on the drum. Step 5: Transferring In this step, the toner attached to the latent image is transferred to the paper. The transfer, or secondary corona, places a positive charge on the paper. Because the drum was charged negatively, the toner on the drum is attracted to the paper. The image is now on the paper and is held in place by the positive charge.\nPrinting Process Step 6: Fusing In this step, the toner is permanently fused to the paper. The printing paper is rolled between a heated roller and a pressure roller.

Cisco Skill's uses WordPress.com has a hosting provider but is not believed to one of the sites hit. There still is no word on who or why they targeted WordPress.com but goes to show that Denial of Service is still a popular type of attack and although simple to set up they can still bring down enterprise networks. So what exactly is denial of service? To make it simple a denial of service can be a range of things but the main goal of a DoS attack is to slow the network down so real traffic can't get access or is extremely unresponsive. One example is using the one of the TCP services and do a SYN flood, which a host or thousands of hosts send thousands of SYN packets to the server. The server sends a SYN ACK but the host does not respond leaving the session open until a timeout occurs. By having all these fake sessions open the server may not be able to handle additional traffic making it seem the service is unavailable. There are many more types of denial of service attacks and the SYN flood is just one example. [caption id=\u0026quot;attachment_840\u0026quot; align=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;300\u0026quot; caption=\u0026quot;Credit: Cisco Inc.\u0026quot;] SYN Attack [/caption] These DoS attacks have been around for a while and they are relatively easy to set up and configure. An attacker could infect machines with a virus that the user or anti-software is unaware of its existence. The virus waits until it has been activated by the remote attacker. This virus could have spread to hundreds of thousands of machines and are waiting for the attacker to start the attack once activated the denial of service starts and the attacker can pick which target to bring down. Matt Mullenweg the founder of WordPress.com wrote an e-mail sent to CNET.com and said the following:\nThere's an ongoing DDoS attack that was large enough to impact all three of our data centers in Chicago, San Antonio, and Dallas--it's currently been neutralized but it's possible it could flare up again later, which we're taking proactive steps to implement. This is the largest and most sustained attack we've seen in our six-year history. We suspect it may have been politically motivated against one of our non-English blogs but we're still investigating and have no definitive evidence yet.\nCheck out my recent post of Understanding TCP to learn how the TCP protocol works in a simplified form.

If not I would recommend you do that first. BackTrack is a Linux penetration testing for network security. This is a free tool that IT administrators can use to audit their network. First put the disk into the tray and restart your computer. This depends on your BIOS setup but you can either set the boot order or go into a boot menu and select the CD tray as the boot device. This is the first thing you will see when you boot into BackTrack you can play around with the different options later but select the screen resolution that is close to your screen size. backtrack Main Once you select the option you want you will see a loading page, this can take some time so be patient! backtrackLoad Once backtrack is done loading then you can start from there and have fun with command-line but if your CLI skills are a little rusty then you can go into the GUI by typing startx and hit enter. backtrack loadst From here you can run BackTrack now (it’s called a Live CD) this could be useful if you just want to look at it and play around with settings that you have no idea what they are or do. That why if you mess something up you can always restart and go back into it without it saving anything! But let’s install this thing! Click on the Install.sh icon. install shell This next window is the installer, it is pretty simple to understand, you want to select your location that is in the same time-zone as you. Install Page 1 This next window is the keyboard layout, Usually USA works for me. install page 2 This next page is the partition manager thing, from here you can dual-boot if you have another OS. (You want to be careful if you do have another OS on the hardrive because you can wipe your other OS from here) For this example I am taking the whole drive. install page 3 The next page gives you a review before you start installing BackTrack this is also a good time to make sure everything is set up properly before you install BackTrack installpage 4 After you click install the installer will start installing!! (amazing! right!) Here you can watch the bar go across the screen or do something productive in this timeframe it takes about 20 to 30 minutes but this also depends on the hardware you have. installpage 5 After it finishes it gives you two options, stay on the live CD or reboot to start BackTrack. (Hint: reboot) Once the machine is rebooting it will take some time so be patient as it is loading. Once it is ready it will ask you for your username and password. The username is root and the password is toor . Once you type that you're in CLI again, if you want to go to the GUI just type startx backtrack start Once you type startx it will load the GUI and you now have a full install of BackTrack! From here you can go to http://www.backtrack-linux.org/ for more information on how to audit your network. backtrackdesk I hope this tutorial was helpful\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/01/install-backtrack/","section":"post","tags":["backtrack","computers","Graphical user interface","Linux","networking","Operating system","operating systems","Security","security","Software","software","technology","tutorial","Tutorials"],"title":"Install BackTrack"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/apple/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Apple"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/hdmi/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"HDMI"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/intel/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Intel"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/intel-corporation/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Intel Corporation"},{"body":"Intel announced on Friday (February 25th 2011) the new high speed connector that will coexists with USB 3.0.

This cable can combine data and high-definition all in one cable running at 10Gbps. So you could say it is like the all in wonder HDMI cable that combines video and audio into one cable. How fast is 10Gbps? Well if you had a full length HD movie so on average 120 minutes it would be able to transfer that movie in less than 30 seconds!! Although the codename was called Light Peak Intel Is running the new technology as an electrical current based on copper. Intel has said that it will work and move the technology over to optical but not schedule has been released yet. This Thunderbolt technology will not replace USB 3.0 according to Jason Ziller, an Intel manager, \u0026quot;They will co-exist on the same platform...in terms of storage (devices) we'll see both products on the market\u0026quot;. You can read more information at Intel's website in the press room about the Thunderbolt Technology. (Thunderbolt Technology: The Fastest Data Connection to Your PC Just Arrived) This technology is pretty cool, but the question is will it take off. Consumers have to buy it in order for it to be a success. Also Apple kind of took the product, although Apple did have some say in the Thunderbolt Technology it feels like at least for now that only Apple will have this.

Every time you connect to a website you are using the HTTP protocol, but below that you are also using a TCP protocol. The nature of TCP is to provide error recovery; there are other services or applications that use TCP. HTTP however is a common protocol that is used in online applications. Remember TCP is not the only protocol in the transport layer of the OSI model, there is another called UDP but that's another day. :)\nTCP stands for (Transmission Control Protocol) what makes TCP shine is its error recovery, this helps other protocols below not worry about if the packet was dropped because TCP will request that packet again. With all of that overhead in TCP it does require more bandwidth, and processing compared to the UDP protocol. TCP has several fields in the header as pictured below.\nLike mentioned TCP has reliability (error recovery) this is made possible by using sequence and acknowledgment numbers (bytes) in the TCP header field. Take the example below the acknowledgment field in the TCP header that was sent by the web browser was 4000, this implies the next byte to be received will have a sequence number of 4000.\nSince the sequence and acknowledgment numbers count the number of bytes, this helps with error control if a TCP segment was lost or caused an error the web browser would send an acknowledgment that the web server that would not be expecting and resend any lost data. An example would be if the web browser only received 2000 bytes, the client would send an acknowledgment of 3000 bytes. When the web server received that information it knows that it sent 3000 bytes of data and the acknowledgment field should be 4000. The web server would resend the third segment again and wait of an acknowledgment of 4000.\nAnother feature TCP has is called flow control; this uses the window field which determines the maximum amount unacknowledged bytes at a given time. The size starts out small and if no errors occur then the window size increases the number of unacknowledged bytes. This speeds up time needed to download the information. If errors start to occur then the windows size decreases, keep in mind that this field will change often as it will continue try to raise the number of unacknowledged bytes.\nTCP is also does a connection establishment and termination. This happens before any data is sent is it will also start the sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers and agree on the port numbers to use. This three-way handshake happens in beginning and at the end when the data transfer is complete. The flags it uses in the TCP header are \u0026quot;SYN\u0026quot; which means synchronize the sequence numbers. \u0026quot;ACK\u0026quot; which is an acknowledgment field and to terminate or finish the connection it will send a \u0026quot;FIN\u0026quot; bit. Although this a brief tutorial and how TCP works in gives you an understanding of the main components that are involved in setting up a TCP connection and finishing a connection. Like always I encourage you if you would like more information a web search will do, along with visiting Cisco.com.

They can cost money and are not cheap to set up and configure. Using CBAC is built-into the Cisco IOS router and helps filter those unwanted protocols that are in your network. When setting up routers as firewalls you have some choices like using CBAC the \u0026quot;Classic\u0026quot; firewall, or zone based policy (ZBF). Today we will talk about CBAC and how to understand the core components of what make CBAC possible. CBAC stands for Content-Base-Access-Control and uses ACLs. (Access Control Lists) Unlike the established TCP session and reflexive ACLs CBAC has several advantages:\nMonitors TCP connections, (Three-way handshake) Maintains UDP session information Tracks TCP sequence numbers Inspects DNS queries and replies Inspect common ICMP messages types Supports applications that rely on multiple connections (FTP) Inspects embedded address Inspects Application Layer information ACLs only look at the network layer and sometimes the transport layer. CBAC is application aware, meaning CBAC is a stateful firewall which keeps track of the state of network connections such as TCP streams, and UDP communication travelling across it. The firewall is programmed to distinguish legitimate packets for different types of connections. Only packets matching a known connection state will be allowed by the firewall; others will be rejected. Because CBAC only matches packets (TCP, UDP and other protocols) it was specified to look at, it will then depend on the ACL if that packet is allowed access or denied. CBAC creates openings in ACLs at the interfaces that inspect the traffic by adding a temporary ACL entry for a specific session. The openings are created when the internal network starts a session with the outside network that would normally be denied. The traffic is only allowed back through the firewall if it is part of the same session and has the correct properties that CBAC is looking for. For example let's say a user starts an http session in the protected network and the packet moves to the outside or unprotected network. CBAC is configured to inspect http traffic and there is an ACL on the inbound (outside interface) blocking http traffic from the unprotected network to the protected network. So the packet is allowed access to the unprotected network because the ACL is on the inbound interface and not the outbound interface. So the ACL does not look at the packet, CBAC however looks at the packet and in the inspection rules the packet is allowed access to the unprotected network, CBAC adds an entry in its state table. Because a new entry is added a dynamic ACL is created on the external interface to the protected network. This dynamic ACL will allow http traffic back into the protected network. This opening is only active it the session is open, once the session closes the ACL is removed. Once removed any traffic that starts from the unprotected network will be denied access to the protected network. This depends on the ACL which checks inbound connections from the unprotected network. CBAC Firewall-config To configure CBAC there are four steps to set up CBAC efficiently:\nPick an interface of where you want CBAC to be inspecting; this depends on the flow of your network and the amount of interfaces you have installed on your router. (DMZ, Web server, E-mail servers, etc.) Configure IP ACLs at the interface. The network technician must define what type of traffic is allowed and will not be inspected by CBAC and which traffic is blocked and will be inspected by CBAC. Define inspection rules. The network technician should specify each desired application layer to inspect along with generic TCP, ICMP and or UDP fields. Inspection rules are configured by statements each listing a protocol and specifying the inspection rule name. Finally apply the inspection rule to an interface. CBAC is considered the \u0026quot;classic\u0026quot; firewall compared to zone based, it is relatively simple to configure and understand. However unlike zone based CBAC can get complex when multiple CBAC configurations on a router exists. Remember CBAC also uses ACLs if configured and implemented poorly these ACLs can block traffic even when CBAC allows them.

What is so great about the 802.11ac development? Well one thing is the speed, it is estimated that it will be able to carry up to 1 gigabit per second! The IEEE has been working on 802.11ac in 2009 and wants to put up a draft on it soon (this year). Products are not yet ready but could be around 2012. It is estimated that a billion 802.11ac devices could be expected in 2015. The standard will be using the existing radio spectrum in ranges below 6GHz and reports say it will have backwards compatibility for older devices. Frank Dickson said, “The goal of 802.11ac is to provide data speeds faster than 802.11n, with speeds of around 1Gbps,\u0026quot; he continued and said, “The timing for 802.11ac approval is to have a draft standard created by 2011 and have the first 802.11ac products out by the end of 2012.\u0026quot; So what does this mean to the average person? Well for the home user they probably would not see a difference if they were browsing online since ISP connection speeds are usually slower than LAN (Local Area Network) speeds. If the average person was streaming videos from another computer within his home or transferring large files they would see a difference. This would be more towards businesses that don’t want to run cables to each computer, and would be more geared to mobile devices like tablets, phones, laptops etc. Not much information is available as the 802.11ac is still under development. Which makes room for changing, but if you want to check out more information you can head over to the IEEE site at http://www.ieee.org\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/21/802.11ac-standard/","section":"post","tags":["802.11ac","Access Point","computers","General","Hardware","IEEE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","Internet","Local Area Network","Mobile device","networking","technology","Wi-Fi","wireless"],"title":"802.11ac Standard"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/access-point/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Access Point"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/mobile-device/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Mobile device"},{"body":"Auto Secure is good for small business or IT administrators that may know how to configure a router with networking protocols, setting up IP interfaces, and networks but really don't have an understanding of the security aspect of the router. So what Cisco has done is implemented a script called Auto Secure. Auto Secure is based on the questions you answer from the prompt usually \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;no\u0026quot; answers. Sometimes the script wants a little more information depending on your network configuration. So there is some customization to fit your network needs but it is almost like a one-step lockdown. So the first thing you will need is to get into the router in by entering user mode. Once their type the command enable and hit enter. [code]Router\u0026gt;enable[/code] Now that you are in privilege EXEC mode type the two-word command auto secure and hit enter. [code]Router#auto secure --- AutoSecure Configuration --- *** AutoSecure configuration enhances the security of the router, but it will not make it absolutely resistant to all security attacks *** AutoSecure will modify the configuration of your device. All configuration changes will be shown. For a detailed explanation of how the configuration changes enhance security and any possible side effects, please refer to Cisco.com for Autosecure documentation. At any prompt you may enter '?' for help. Use ctrl-c to abort this session at any prompt. Gathering information about the router for AutoSecure[/code] Once you hit enter it will start the script and will look like something in the above code box. Here you can see that although Auto Secure is helpful in locking down your network it will not make it resistant to all network attacks. If you also notice that the Auto Secure script will modify the configuration of my device and could cause network issues. Reading further down and a feature that I like the best is that Auto Secure will show all configuration changes before it changes anything! So you could then research what each command does at Cisco.com or you could apply the configuration on the running-config, and see if there are any network problems. If there are you can simply reload the router and not save the configuration. What this does is wipe the entire Auto Secure configuration away and once the router reboots you are now left with the unsecured router. You can always hit ctrl-c to abort Auto Secure and hit the question mark key for additional information. So the first thing the prompt asked me was this router connected to the internet? For the is example I will say yes and hit enter [code]Is this router connected to internet? [no]: yes[/code] The next thing it asked me was how many interfaces are facing the internet? For this example I accept the default value which was 1 [code]Enter the number of interfaces facing the internet [1]: 1[/code] The next thing the Auto Secure prompt wanted was me to type the interface that was connected or facing the internet? For this example I typed the serial0/0/0 interface. [code]Interface IP-Address OK? Method Status Protocol FastEthernet0/0 unassigned YES unset administratively down down FastEthernet0/1 unassigned YES unset administratively down down Serial0/0/0 172.16.2.241 YES manual down down Serial0/0/1 unassigned YES unset administratively down down Vlan1 unassigned YES unset administratively down down Enter the interface name that is facing the internet: serial0/0/0[/code] It will then go and disable and enable some services like outputted below but only after you apply them at the end of the Auto Secure prompt. [code]Securing Management plane services... Disabling service finger Disabling service pad Disabling udp \u0026amp; tcp small servers Enabling service password encryption Enabling service tcp-keepalives-in **Output Omitted** [/code] The next step Auto Secure wants me to do is type a security banner, which will show every time somebody ties to access device. This all depends on your network, for this example I just typed Authorized Access Only. (You will need a delimiter) [code]Enter the security banner {Put the banner between k and k, where k is any character}:*Authorized Access Only*[/code] The next Auto Secure will want is a secret password. This password must be at least six characters long, this password is also encrypted in MD5. It will also want an enable password which is not encrypted. (For older routers that may not support encryption) It also must be different from the secret password. [code]Enable secret is either not configured or is the same as enable password Enter the new enable secret: Enter the new enable password:[/code] Auto Secure will want a local user database, so enter the username and password of the user. [code]Configuration of local user database Enter the username: Username Enter the password: password Confirm the passord: password[/code] Next Auto Secure will tell you that AAA will be enabled with local authentication, it will then want a blocking period when login attacks are detected, maximum login failures, and maximum time period for crossing the failed login attempts. [code]Blocking Period when Login Attack detected: # Maximum Login failures with the device: # Maximum time period for crossing the failed login attempts: #[/code] Depending on your network you may want SSH on for this example I said yes. When setting up the SSH it wants a hostname, and a domain-name. [code]Configure SSH server? [yes]: yes Enter the host name: {Router Name} Enter the domain-name: {Yourdomain-name}[/code] Depending on your network needs you may want a CBAC firewall. For this example we said yes. Now you will see the secure configuration generated you then could copy down the configuration and not apply it to the running-config and research what each command does. You could apply it to the running-config and then wait and see if any problems arise. If they do you can reload the router without saving the configuration you would then be back with an unsecured but configured router. [code]Configure CBAC Firewall feature? [yes/no]: yes This is the configuration generated: ! Disabling service finger Disabling service pad Disabling udp \u0026amp; tcp small servers Enabling service password encryption Enabling service tcp-keepalives-in **Output Omitted** Apply this configuration to running-config? [yes]:[/code] You can find more information about the Auto Secure feature at Cisco.com and I hope this tutorial was helpful.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/17/cisco-ios-routers-auto-secure/","section":"post","tags":["CCNA","CCNA Security","Cisco","cisco","ICND2","Internet","networking","router","security","technology","tutorial","Tutorials"],"title":"Cisco IOS Routers: Auto Secure"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/binary/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"binary"},{"body":"When working with IP addresses and subnet masks you need to have an understanding of how binary works. Binary is still used in computers today, when computers use numbers and letters they use them in a binary format. This guide will be going over numbers, and focusing on the IP addresses in how a computer sees that decimal number. Binary is a relatively easy in understanding and is just another way of looking at numbers. You can do the same basic math in binary as with decimal numbers like adding and multiplying them. The first thing in understanding how binary works is that in binary there is only two digits zeros (0) and ones (1). Working with these two numbers seems easy but if the number is large, it does take some time in converting to binary and from binary. Binary works in the power of twos so with that said let's look at how to convert binary into a decimal number.\n01101\nAlright we have a number in binary format how can we tell what that number that is? Well remember that binary works in the power of twos. So what I do is I count the number of digits (ones and zeros) in the binary number (five for this example) I then write down the powers of two and continue to write them down until I have five numbers start always start with 1 and work from right to left (example)\n16 8 4 2 1\nNow we just have to line up these together and add only the numbers that have a one (1). So for this example I would add 8+4+1= 13 thirteen is my answer! You will do the same thing no matter how long the binary number is so let's do one more\n1100101011\nThis binary number has ten (10) digits so we will put also put ten (10) numbers each the power of two. Remember to start from one (1) and work right to left. (Example)\n512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1\nAgain line these numbers up with the binary and add only the numbers that have a one (1) so I would add 512+256+32+8+2+1=811 eight-hundred and eleven is my answer. Ok we can convert from binary to decimal but can we convert from decimal to binary? If we do the opposite we will be to do just that. So let's continue. The number will be sixty-seven\n67\nYou now put the same powers of two chart up, but you will start at the highest number first so for this example I would start at 128 (left to right), I know I would not use 128 but it is always a good idea to have a number higher than the one you are trying to convert to binary. (Example)\n128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1\nAlright I have the chart up and now I will just say is this number higher or lower than the number I am trying to convert? (67 for this example) I start at 128 and say the number is lower so I will add a zero (0) bit and move to the next digit. I am at 64 and the number is now higher so I will add a (1) bit and subtract that from 67 (67-64=3 three for this example) I will then use the number three (3) until I finish completing the binary conversion. Continuing I move to 32 and say is the number three (3) higher or lower than 32? It is lower so I add another zero (0) bit. Move to the next digit which is 16 and say is the number three (3) higher or lower than 16? It is lower so I add another zero (0) bit. I do the same thing for the next digit which is 4, is number three (3) higher or lower than 4? It is lower so I add another zero (0) bit. Moving to the next digit which is 2, is the number three (3) higher or lower than 2? It is higher than 2 I then will add a one (1) bit. I will also subtract 2 from 3 (3-2=1 which is now one (1). I now have the last number which is one (1) and since my new number that I subtracted is also a one (1) I will add a one (1) bit to the binary number. (Subtract 1-1=0)\n01000011\nAgain you can use this format for larger numbers as well so if we use 156 (one-hundred-and fifty-six) we put up the chart.\n256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1\nI start at 256 and say is this number higher or lower than 156? It is lower so I add a zero. I will continue down the chart until my total is zero.

These protocols need to have (AAA) authentication, authorization, and accounting setup on the routers before you can set up these access server protocols. First let's get some information on why we would need this type of access server protocol setup. Usually you will find this setup in medium to enterprise environments. What the access server does is provide a central location of all the users and privileges these users can do on network resources. If we did not have a server we would have to put these users manually on the Cisco IOS software and that could be time-consuming depending on how many devices (routers, switches) there are in your network infrastructure. So what can RADIUS and TACACS+ do? Both can provide a central location on who can access the network resources but both are different in how they authorize users. RADIUS is an access sever that uses the AAA and uses the UDP protocol. For Network security the information that is sent between the client and the server is authenticated by a shared password which is never sent over the network. Also any user passwords are encrypted between the client and the server. However one thing that is different between TACACS+ and RADIUS is with TACACS+ the whole packet is encrypted, RADIUS only encrypts the password everything else is in plain text for example the user name. RADIUS is able to support a variety of methods to authenticate a user when a username and password are sent. RADIUS can support PPP, PAP, CHAP, UNIX login and other authentication mechanisms. Over TACACS+ RADIUS is also available for free at various websites. Finally RADIUS combines authentication and authorization meaning once the user has been granted access the RAIDUS server is done and no longer is involved. RADIUS sends the privileges to the network device and it is up to the device to be able to allow or disallow certain commands and functions. RAIDUS Server TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP which offers several advantages:\nTCP usages provide a separate acknowledgment that a request has been received, regardless of how loaded and slow the backend authentication mechanism. TCP provides immediate indication of a crashed, or not running, server by a reset (RST). You can determine when a server crashes and returns to service if you use long−lived TCP connections. UDP cannot tell the difference between a server that is down, a slow server, and a non−existent server. Using TCP keepalives, server crashes can be detected out−of−band with actual requests. Connections to multiple servers can be maintained simultaneously, and you only need to send messages to the ones that are known to be up and running. TCP is also more scalable and adapts to growing, as well as congested, networks. Like mentioned above TACACS+ encrypts the entire packet, besides the standard header, RADIUS only encrypts the password. TACACS+ uses the AAA protocol like RADIUS but during a session the client checks with TACACS+ server to determine if the user is granted permission to use different commands and or functions. By doing this it provides greater control over commands that can be executed on the network resources. TACACS+ This may sound like TACACS+ is the preferred protocol but this all depends on your network needs RAIDUS is a great protocol for just usernames and passwords so in the end it all depends but both offer a central environment and that's my summary of the two protocols.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/10/tacacs-plus-and-radius/","section":"post","tags":["CCNA","CCNA Security","Cisco","cisco","networking","RADIUS","router","Security","security","Software","software","TACACS","technology"],"title":"TACACS Plus and RADIUS"},{"body":"This guide will go over how to configure RIPv2 on Cisco routers. This guide follows a packet tracer activity that is posted at the end of this tutorial. RIPv2 configuration is pretty simple to understand with really only three required commands to use besides the network command which depends how many networks are connected to your router. RIPv2 Layout So following the packet tracer that is used with this tutorial the first step is to configure the hostname on the routers. Enter into the router and type the command enable to move into privilege EXEC mode, then type configure terminal to move into global configuration mode and type hostname then the name of the router. (this example is for R1) [code]Router\u0026gt;enable Router#configure terminal Router(config)#hostname R1[/code] The next thing you need to do is to configure the interfaces on R1, R2, and R3 and remember to put a clock rate on the serial interfaces of R1 and R2 (s0/0/1) the clock rate the packet tracer will accept is 64000. The following are the outputs for each router. R1's Interface Setup: [code]R1(config)#interface fa0/0 R1(config-if)#ip address 192.168.1.62 255.255.255.192 R1(config-if)#no shut R1(config-if)#exit R1(config)#interface s0/0/0 R1(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.193 255.255.255.252 R1(config-if)#clock rate 64000 R1(config-if)#no shut R1(config-if)#exit R1(config)#interface s0/0/1 R1(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.197 255.255.255.252 R1(config-if)#clock rate 64000 R1(config-if)#no shut[/code] R2's Interface Setup: [code]R2(config)#interface fa0/0 R2(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.126 255.255.255.192 R2(config-if)#no shut R2(config-if)#exit R2(config)#interface s0/0/0 R2(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.194 255.255.255.252 R2(config-if)#no shut R2(config-if)#exit R2(config)#interface s0/0/1 R2(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.201 255.255.255.252 R2(config-if)#clock R2(config-if)#clock rate 64000 R2(config-if)#no shut[/code] R3's Interface Setup: [code]R3(config)#interface fa0/0 R3(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.190 255.255.255.192 R3(config-if)#no shut R3(config-if)#exit R3(config)#interface s0/0/0 R3(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.202 255.255.255.252 R3(config-if)#no shut R3(config-if)#exit R3(config)#interface s0/0/1 R3(config-if)#ip add 192.168.1.198 255.255.255.252 R3(config-if)#no shut[/code] The above commands have configured the interfaces for R1, R2, and R3. The next part of the step is to configure the PCs IP address and the default gateway. The default gateway is the router's fast ethernet interface. For example PC-A's default gateway would be 192.168.1.62. The next and final step is to configure RIPv2 on all the routers. You will use the same command for all the routers in this tutorial. [code]R1(config)#router rip R1(config-router)#version 2 R1(config-router)#network 192.168.1.0[/code] You may be wondering why you would use 192.168.1.0 network and not the different subnets connected to each router. This topology is using VLSM (variable-length subnet masking) so the router only needs the 192.168.1.0 network. You also should be at a 100 percent and able to ping every device.

ACLs can get confusing and cause network problems if not implemented correctly. I think what I outlined below explains in a nutshell of what you can expect from ACLs.\nI would still read and find more information about ACLs on the web and or reading material (becuase I don't trust myself!). By securing networks with ACLs you are adding another barrier to your network although ACLs can't fool-proof your network they add additional level of security from the outside world. The simple definition of an ACL (access control list) is a sequential list of permit or deny statements that apply to the IP address and or upper-layer protocols. ACLs are a powerful way to control network traffic into and out of your network. Packet filtering sometimes called static filtering, controls access to a network by analyzing the incoming and outgoing packets. A router is considered a packet filter when it forwards or denies packets according to filtering rules. Packet filtering works at the network layer of the OSI model. The ACL can get the following information from the packer header:\nSource IP address Destination IP address ICMP message type An ACL can also get information from upper-layer protocols:\nTCP/UDP source port TCP/UDP destination port Remember the three Ps Per protocol, Per direction, and Per interface\nOne ACL per protocol- To control traffic flow on an interface an ACL must be defined for each protocol enabled on the interface (example IP, IPX, AppleTalk) One ACL per direction- ACLs control traffic in one direction at one time on an interface. You must create two separate ACLs to control traffic in both inbound and outbound connections. One ACL per interface- ACLs control traffic for an interface such as Fast Ethernet. Types of Cisco ACLs\nStandard ACLs filter packets based on source IP addresses only.\nExtended ACLs filter packets based on:\nSource and destination IP address Source and destination TCP and UDP ports Protocol type (IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP or protocol number) Standard ACLs Standard ACLs allow you to permit or deny traffic from a source IP address. The packet's destination and ports involved do not matter. (Example the following ACL statement allows all traffic from the network 192.168.30.0/24\n1Router(config)#access-list 10 permit 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 Remember there is ALWAYS an implied \u0026quot;deny all\u0026quot; at the end of each ACL statement. (This example is blocking all other network traffic besides what is allowed) Also remember that Standard ACLs are created in global configuration mode.\nExtended ACLs Extended ACLs filter IP packets based on protocol type, source and destination IP address, source TCP or UDP ports, destination TCP or UDP ports and optional protocol type information for finger granularity control. (Example in the following ACL statement, ACL 103 permits traffic originating from any address on the 192.168.30.0/24 network to any destination host using port 80 (HTTP)\n1Router(config)#access-list 103 permit tcp 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80 Extended ACLs are created in global configuration mode.\nDynamic ACLs Dynamic or lock-and-key ACLs are available for Internet Protocol traffic only. Dynamic ACLs starts with the application of an extended ACL to block traffic through the router. Common reasons to use Dynamic ACLs are:\nWhen you want a specific remote user or group of remote users to access a host within your network. Connecting to the outside of your network (Internet) Lock-and-key authenticates the user and then permits limited access through your firewall router. You want a subset of hosts on a local network to access a host from a remote network that is protected by a firewall. Lock-and-key requires users to authenticate through an AAA, TACACS server or other security server before it allows access.\nReflexive ACLs Reflexive ACLs allow IP packets to be filtered based on upper-layer session information. Generally are used to allow outbound traffic and to limit inbound traffic by using sessions that originate inside the router. When a router sees a new outbound connection it adds an entry to a temporary ACL to allow replies back into the network. Reflexive ACLs can be defined only with an extended named IP ACL. They cannot be defined with numbered or standard named ACLs or with other protocols.\nTime-Based ACLs Time-Based ACLs are like extended ACLs in function, but they allow access control based on time. To use time-based ACLs you create a time range that defines specific times of the day and days of the week. You use the time range with a name and then refer to it by a function. The time range relies on the router system clock. This feature works with NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization, but the router clock can also be used.\nNumbered ACL You can assign a number based on whether your ACL is standard or extended\n1 to 99 and 1300 to 1999 are Standard IP ACL 100 to 199 and 2000 to 2699 are Extended IP ACL You cannot add or delete entries within the ACL (You have to totally delete the ACL in order to edit it)\nNamed ACL You can assign names to the ACL instead of numbers.\nNames can contain alphanumeric characters Recommended to type the name in all CAPITAL LETTERS Names cannot contain spaces or punctuation and must begin with an alphabetic character You can add or delete entries within the ACL You can specify whether the ACL is standard or extended The remark keyword is used for documentation and makes the access lists easier to understand. Each remark is limited to 100 characters. (Example)\n1R1#config t 2Enter configuration commands one per line. End with CTRL/Z 3R1(config)#access-list 10 remark Permit hosts from the 192.168.10.0 LAN 4R1(config)#access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.0 5R1(config)#exit 6R1# 7*Oct 25 20:34:23:13: %SYS-5-CONFIG\\_I: configured from console by console 8R1# show run Building configuration… 9!\u0026lt;output omitted\u0026gt;! 10access-list 10 remark Permit hosts from the 192.168.10.0 LAN access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.0 11!\u0026lt;output omitted\u0026gt;! Creating a Named ACL Naming an ACL makes it easier to understand its function. (Example shows the commands used to configure a standard named ACL on router R1) Keep in mind this is the same command you would use if you wanted an extended ACL just substitute standard for extended. Interface fa0/0 denies hosts on the 192.168.11.10 network access to the 192.168.10.0 network is as follows:\n1R1(config)#ip access-list standard NO_ACCESS 2R1(config-std-nacl)#deny host 192.168.11.10 3R1(config-std-nacl)#permit 192.168.11.0.0.0.255 4R1(config-std-nacl)#interface fa0/0 5R1(config-if)#ip access-group NO_ACCESS out That's my view on Access Control Lists, if you want to have more documentation about ACLs you can check out these two links below from Cisco Configuring IP Access Lists Access Control Lists: Overview and Guidelines I hope this tutorial was helpful.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/07/access-control-lists/","section":"post","tags":["ACL","CCNA","Cisco","ICND2","networking","router","security","technology","tutorial"],"title":"Access Control Lists"},{"body":"IPv4 maybe on its last leg with only a few blocks of IPv4 addresses available, computer estimates say that the IANA address depletion was January 27, 2011. Also the calculations for all central IPv4 pool addresses will be depleted by July 25, 2012.\nThese are estimates and may change as of writing this post. I'll be sure to update if needed, but the thing to understand is that IPv4 won't be available within weeks if not months. So what happens then? Well we move into IPv6 which has the capacity to hold 2^128th addresses that number is 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456. If you want to know what that number is called it is 340 undecillion, 282 decillion, 366 nonillion, 920 octillion, 938 septillion, 463 sextillion, 463 quintillion, 374 quadrillion, 607 trillion, 431 billion, 768 million, 211 thousand and 456 addresses.\nThese address are in hexadecimal form and are 128 bits in length compared to IPv4 which is in a 32 bits in length. One problem with IPv4 and IPv6 is they don't get along, they are not backwards compatible. You can either go to IPv6, IPv4 or dual stack the technology. This can be a problem if computer industries did not make a plan beforehand and are now scrambling to implement IPv6. Experts have known that the IPv4 address space would run out the only issue was \u0026quot;when\u0026quot;. That's why IPv6 was design in the 1990s. To help companies test and configure IPv6 the Internet Society is helping to organize the World IPv6 Day.\nOn June 8, companies like Google and Yahoo and distributors like Akamai and Limelight Networks will offer their services over IPv6 for 24 hours for evaluation and troubleshooting sessions. What about users? Well if you have a recent operating system like Windows XP, Vista and 7 IPv6 is ready to go, if not already running on your computer. So your computer can handle it. The only problem is your Internet Service Provider and or DSL and cable modem. One test you can do is at this site http://www.test-ipv6.com/. It will be able to tell you if you can access both IPv4 and IPv6 sites or only IPv4 or IPv6.\nToday at 9:30am Eastern Standard Time the Number Resource Organization (NRO), along with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the Internet Society (ISOC) and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) will be holding a ceremony and press conference to make a significant announcement and to discuss the global transition to the next generation of Internet addresses. You can check out the live webcast at http://www.nro.net/news/icann-nro-live-stream\nPersonally I can't wait for IPv6 it really is a totally different internet protocol and does have benefits in moving from IPv4 to IPv6. Like less overhead in the packet format and forwarding, and introduces a mandatory Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) which is optional in IPv4. These are some of the many improvements that IPv6 has in comparison to IPv4. Sure there might be problems with customers and service providers but if you ISP did their job you as a user should not even notice a difference.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/02/03/ipv4-meet-ipv6/","section":"post","tags":["computers","General","Internet","ipv4","ipv6","networking","technology"],"title":"IPv4 Meet IPv6"},{"body":"While reading the Cisco Annual Report they came up with seven common social engineering attacks that cybercriminals use. Now these types of attacks are common and are not unheard of. You should be familiar with most if not all these weaknesses that cybercriminals use.\nSex appeal, which means scammers will try to find or put up attractive man or woman. Then tempt the user for information. People should remember if you don't know the person this will more than likely not be romance but something else. (Like your personal information)\nGreed, there is this saying and I'm sure you've heard of it, \u0026quot;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\u0026quot;. This could be anything from a free iPod offer, to those Nigerian wire transfer offers. Don't provide them with your personal information!\nVanity, which means you have been chosen or that you are a winner in some contest that you did not enter. Or that you have been selected in a group of winners and are receiving a share. Again these types of scams are meant to give your personal information away to somebody you don't know.\nTrust, which can be implied or transient. Implied is the attempt to convince individuals that they represent a high-profile brand. (Apple, Microsoft, Dell, HP) and therefore can be trusted. With transient trust scammers pretend to be a trusted companion of someone you know but have never heard of them. Users should always be aware that anything that involves a trust relationship should send some flags.\nLaziness, this could be anything from misspellings in e-mails, messages, and websites. If the URL in the website is misspelled or that e-mail from your bank. Those should be warnings that the information is also fake.\nCompassion, scammers love those kindhearted people. This could be anything from nonexistent nonprofits, such like major disasters. (Like the earthquake in Haiti) Along with the 2009 scam that involved Facebook. Hijacking users’ accounts then posting and claiming that the account holder was stranded somewhere and needed money. Users should be aware and maintain a high level of skepticism toward these types of messages.\nUrgency, there are tons of scams that insist on a fast response and tell the potential victim to “act now” or that “time is running out.” These types of messages don't always come in e-mails or the web. There are phone calls claiming they need personal or company files. Users should always check the company and should never feel pressured to respond immediately. Always be aware of these weaknesses and if and doubt don't!\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/01/27/common-weaknesses-cybercriminals-exploit/","section":"post","tags":["computers","e-mail","General","Internet","safety","scams","Security"],"title":"Common Weaknesses Cybercriminals Exploit"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/e-mail/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"e-mail"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/safety/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"safety"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/scams/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"scams"},{"body":"One of the things you do first when setting up a Cisco router in lab environments and production environments is basic router configuration. By having a good understanding of basic router configuration you will have the essential building blocks and be able to apply additional knowledge upon router configuration. This tutorial is assuming that you are in a lab environment, additional security measures for production environments are recommended and are not discussed in this tutorial. Also this tutorial is assuming a terminal emulator session is on and ready. (Hyper-Terminal, Putty, etc).\nThe first thing you should always do when first configuring a router is erase the startup configuration. This assures us that anything that might have been saved or loaded is gone and won't affect are configurations. First make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode on the router by typing enable:\n1Router\u0026gt;enable 2Router# The # symbol tells us that we are in privileged EXEC mode.\nThen in privileged EXEC mode issue the command erase startup-config. The router will give you a warning and tell you to that you are about to erase the NVRAM hit enter. If you are prompted to save changes type no (If you typed yes than it will save the running-config to the startup-config and that defeats the purpose of erasing the startup-config file.)\n1Router#erase startup-config 2Erasing the nvram filesystem will remove all files! Continue? [confirm] 3[OK] 4Erase of nvram: complete 5Router# When the prompt returns to Router# issue the reload command. If prompted to save changes type no and hit enter. The router will now reload and be ready to configure. When the router finishes loading make sure you type no for the auto-install.\n1Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]: no 2Would you like to terminate autoinstall? [yes]: 3Press Enter to accept default. 4Press RETURN to get started! Enter privileged EXEC mode then type configure terminal:\n1Router\u0026gt;enable 2Router#configure terminal 3Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. 4Router(config)# To configure the router name enter the hostname command followed by the name or letters you want the router to be called (for this example I picked R1):\n1Router(config)#hostname R1 2R1(config)# Disable DNS Lookup with the no ip domain-lookup command:\n1R1(config)#no ip domain-lookup 2R1(config)# Configure an EXEC mode password, by using the enable secret [password] The word secret provides better security by storing the password in a non-reversible cryptographic function in MD5 hash. (For this example the password we will be allknowing)\n1R1(config)#enable secret allknowing 2R1(config)# Configure the message-of-the-day banner using the command banner motd. You can use any message, but make it aware that only authorized personal can enter the router. (For this example I typed this up)\n1R1(config)#banner motd 2Enter TEXT message. End with the character \u0026#39;\u0026amp;\u0026#39;. 3 ******************************** 4 !!!AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY!!! 5 ******************************** 6\u0026amp; 7R1(config)# Configure the console password on the router (Make sure you are still in privileged EXEC mode) and type line console 0 for the password. It's encouraged to use a different password than the enable secret (for this example I'll use knowingall) type login to allow password checking. This password will be placed at the console line.\n1R1(config)#line console 0 2R1(config-line)#password knowingall 3R1(config-line)#login 4R1(config-line)#exit 5R1(config)# Configure the password for the virtual terminal lines, again make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode and type line vty 0 4. The password should be a different as well. The VTY lines are used to remote into the router it can be an insecure method and can send passwords and commands in plain text if not properly setup. If you will never use VTY lines then you can just type login first and then exit without typing a password. That will make it so you can't connect to the router remotely. (For this example however we are using VTY Lines and the password will be knowing)\n1R1(config)#line vty 0 4 2R1(config-line)#password knowing 3R1(config-line)#login 4R1(config-line)#exit 5R1(config)# The next and final command is optional but is a helpful one, if you don't want those random messages popping up while you are typing. The command is called logging synchronous and is issued in the line configuration mode for the console port. (Make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode and type line console 0 hit enter and type logging synchronous.\n1R1(config)#line console 0 2R1(config-line)#logging synchronous 3R1(config-line)#exit 4R1(config)# That's it! This basic router configuration is on every Cisco Lab so you will end up being able to do this in your sleep! One final thing that I forgot to mention, and a lot of people forget to do when they are stuck or can't remember that command is to use that question mark. Which can be entered at the prompt or at a command to display a list of available commands and parameters. This is helpful because the router will give you a brief summary of what that command will do. If you use the question mark it will become your best friend! (for example issuing the question mark at privileged EXEC mode gives me a list of all of the commands I can use and more available if I hit the space bar).\n1Router#? 2Exec commands: 3 \u0026lt;1-99\u0026gt; Session number to resume 4 auto Exec level Automation 5 clear Reset functions 6 clock Manage the system clock 7 configure Enter configuration mode 8 connect Open a terminal connection 9 copy Copy from one file to another 10 debug Debugging functions (see also \u0026#39;undebug\u0026#39;) 11 delete Delete a file 12 dir List files on a filesystem 13 disable Turn off privileged commands 14 disconnect Disconnect an existing network connection 15 enable Turn on privileged commands 16 erase Erase a filesystem 17 exit Exit from the EXEC 18 logout Exit from the EXEC 19 mkdir Create new directory 20 more Display the contents of a file 21 no Disable debugging informations 22 ping Send echo messages 23 reload Halt and perform a cold restart 24 --More-- I can then go further (if needed) into a command and hit the question mark. (For example if I type the copy command followed by a space and a question mark I get the following output). You can use this method and every command no matter how long or short the command is.\n1Router#copy ? 2 flash: Copy from flash: file system 3 ftp: Copy from ftp: file system 4 running-config Copy from current system configuration 5 startup-config Copy from startup configuration 6 tftp: Copy from tftp: file system Knowing every command in a router is not needed, instead I would know your way around it and use the available help tools built into the software.

This shift in focusing on mobile devices and platforms instead of computers means one thing, it’s easier. What does that mean? Well think of it this way if I was hacker wanting to gain access to somebody’s personal information, and I had a choice between their computer or their mobile phone which one would I choose? Now before I give my answer think of this, computer operating systems like Windows, and Mac have been around for a while so they both have had their share of virus, worms, and trojans especially Windows as it’s a widely and commonly used operating system.\nMobile devices like the iPhone, Android and others are relatively new and don’t have much of a security history behind them. Mobile devices especially now can hold a lot of information. Your phone is usually your personal and business phone, all the better to target mobile platforms. So the device I would pick in the end would be the mobile phone. Apple released iOS4 (June 21, 2010) which was said to contain over 60 patches and updates to the device. But one thing that is truly a security threat towards the iPhones, and iPads and other iOS devices is “jailbreaking”. This unlocks the software so the user can download additional applications, extensions and themes that are unavailable through the official App Store (which is software approved by Apple).\nIn the United States jailbreaking is legal and does not violate copyright laws. Since then more than million users have jailbroken their iPhones. (According to Electronic Frontier Foundation) Software that is installed and not approved by Apple could be a security risk by creating the potential of sensitive data leaks, and viruses.\nWhat about Android? One thing that is different from Android is it’s a flexible operating system. Meaning it’s already on smartphones and tablets but plans to have the software in cars, and other devices. The growth of this open source software and the number of users makes this operating system attractive to developers along with hackers. Since Android is open source unlike Apple people can have access to the source code, including potential attackers. This makes it easier for attackers to put up rouge applications and viruses.\nOne thing you can do to protect yourself is to be aware of the types of apps you download. To me it seems like people think or are simply unaware that viruses and harmful software can be installed on your mobile phone or device, just like if you were on computer. If it’s a third-party application not on the Android or Apple marketplace be especially careful. There is also anti-virus software for your phone if you want another layer of added protection. The last thing is if you have an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) don’t jailbreak it! Apple will likely end your user license agreement and you run the risk of viruses, faulty programs and even hardware failures.\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/01/24/cybercriminals-focusing-on-mobile-platforms/","section":"post","tags":["android","Apple","iphone","phones","Security","security","tablets","technology"],"title":"Cybercriminals Focusing on Mobile Platforms"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/iphone/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"iphone"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/phones/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"phones"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/tablets/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"tablets"},{"body":"In this simple tutorial we are going to be configuring a static NAT which is a one-to-one mapping between an inside IP address and an outside IP address. (One private to one permanent address) Using this type of NAT would be helpful for outside devices accessing your inside devices. (Like a web server) Let's get started!!\nLooking at the topology above you can see that we have a server inside of are network and want people to access this server outside of are network. Using NAT will help us accomplish this task! (This tutorial is assuming that all configurations, like basic router configurations and IP addresses are in place and working before NAT is enabled for the above topology) In order for one to one mapping to work we first need to make an IP route that forwards the public IP address or addresses out towards the ISP. So on the router we would make an IP route to forward that IP address to the ISP router or the internet cloud.\n1Router(config)#ip route 209.200.210.5 255.255.255.252 s0/0/1 The above command tells us that if the router sees this IP address (209.200.210.5 which is the public IP address assigned to us by the ISP) it will forward the packet out the serial interface of s0/0/1. The ISP will then forward the information to the destination. The next thing to do is create a static mapping on the router. This static mapping will be permanently assigned to an inside IP address and mapped to an outside IP address. You can make more than one, one to one mapping but remember you will also need additional public IP addresses from the ISP for each private address you want to translate. So the command to translate the server IP address into a public IP address would look like:\n1Router(config)#ip nat inside source static 192.168.5.254 209.200.210.5 This command tells us that the IP address of 192.168.5.254 will be translated to 209.200.210.5. So any device outside of our network will be able to reach the server by using the 209.200.210.5 IP address.\nThen you want to define the \u0026quot;inside\u0026quot; of your network and the \u0026quot;outside\u0026quot; of your network. So for this example the router's fastethernet 0/0 interface would be the inside of are network. (We have control over it) Move to the interface and use the ip nat inside command.\n1Router(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/0 2Router(config-if)#ip nat inside This command tells us that the fast ethernet interface 0/0 is in the inside of are network. You can also assign or have more than one ip nat inside interface. You also want to define the \u0026quot;outside\u0026quot; of your network. So for example the router's serial interface s0/0/1 would be the outside network. Move to the interface and use the ip nat outside command.\n1Router(config)#interface s0/0/1 2Router(config-if)#ip nat outside This command tells us that the serial interface of s0/0/1 and anything connected to it is the outside network (We don't have control over it.) You can also assign or have more than one ip nat outside interface. That's it!! You now have a one to one mapping to a public IP address. Remember that this tutorial is assuming that the ISP router (internet cloud for this topology) has a way back to the NAT router. If not than your device will be able to send information however any information trying to travel back to your device will fail. (So if you have control of the ISP router like in lab environments than just apply a static route back to the NAT router.) Hope this tutorial was Helpful!\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/2011/01/21/configuring-nat-one-to-one-mapping/","section":"post","tags":["CCENT","CCNA","Cisco","cisco","NAT","networking","tutorial","Tutorials","WAN"],"title":"Configuring NAT (One to One Mapping)"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/nat/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"NAT"},{"body":"This tutorial will help you configure PAT (Port Address Translation), or sometimes called NAT (Network Address Translation) with overload on a Cisco router. PAT uses multiple private IP addresses and translates them into a single or very few public IP addresses. This is possible because the private IP addresses are mapped to the port number of the PC. Let's get started!!!\nWith the above shown topology we see that we are using two routers called ISP and R1 we also have one switch (default configuration) and a PC connected to R1's Fa0/0 interface. Both routers need to be setup with basic router configuration and IP address added to the interfaces of ISP and R1 along with the PC to be configured with the supplied IP address. Also a default-gateway on the PC and clock rate on ISP's serial interface before we can get stated. (This tutorial is assuming you can already do that) ;) Now that the basic setups have been configured we need an IP route on R1 to ISP. We want to define that any IP address not in R1's routing table needs to be sent to the ISP. To do that move to global configuration mode and type the command ip route and the IP address of ISP's serial interface:\n1R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.220.198.2 You can do this two ways, use the IP address of ISP (like above) OR use the exit interface of R1. (like below)\n1R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0/0 The next thing we need is an ACL (Access-Control-List). Adding a standard ACL defines which addresses are to be translated with NAT (example):\n1R1(config)#access-list 5 permit 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255 The above command makes an access-control list. But an ACL is no good if we don't apply it. We now need to apply this ACL to R1. Remember to specify the access list number that you made earlier. (example):\n1R1(config)#ip nat inside source list 5 interface serial s0/0/0 overload The above command tells us that we want to use the access list number \u0026quot;5\u0026quot; (which says that the 172 network is allowed to be translated into a public IP address) with interface s0/0/0 and put overload on that interface. (Overload is the keyword that makes this possible!!) On R1 move to the interface configuration mode, tell the router which interface has the private IP addresses by using the ip nat inside command (this would be R1's Fast-Ethernet 0/0 interface):\n1R1(config)#interface fa0/0 2R1(config-if)#ip nat inside You also want to configure the outside interface on R1. That would be the serial 0/0/0 interface.\n1R1(config)#interface s0/0/0 2R1(config-if)#ip nat outside This command tells us that R1's interface s0/0/0 is the outside interface (This is the location of the public IP addresses or ISP) That's it!! This is simple tutorial that uses PAT or Port Address Translation also called NAT with overload!

This tutorial includes Basic Configuration tasks on a router, Configuring OSPF routing protocol, and Configuring PPP PAP and CHAP authentication. Let's get started!\nWe can see in the above diagram we will be using three routers, a loop back connection, two switches (which we will leave them at their default configuration) and two PCs If you are using packet tracer or using real devices than cable the network. The next couple of steps are assuming you already know the material. Next perform Basic Router Configurations (hostname, disable DNS lookup, EXEC password, message-of-the-day banner, and password for console and VTY connections, along with synchronous logging). After that, configure the interfaces on R1, R2, and R3 (with the IP addresses from the addressing table (remember to include the clock rate on serial DCE interfaces). Make sure that the IP addressing is correct and the interfaces are active by issuing the show ip interface brief command. Test and configure ethernet interfaces on PC1 and PC3 (test by pinging the default gateway)\nOK, now that all devices are connected we can start by configuring OSPF (so that each router knows about each other network).

If you guessed that the link would go down you are correct. But also OSPF would get rid of that route in the routing table. You have to be careful when configuring PPP especially on a production network. You run the risk of making you network inoperable if you are not careful setting the different encapsulations. To change the encapsulation from HDLC to PPP on R1, R2, and R3. Go to the interface of the serial connection and type encapsulation ppp. (yes it is really that simple).

The first one we will use is (PAP) password authentication protocol. PAP is not a secure authentication protocol. Passwords are sent using plain text and only authenticates once. To set up PAP the username and password must match the other router. So for this example R1's username is R1 and the password is knowing.\n1R1(config)#username R1 password knowing Keep in mind that this information needs to be typed on R2 for PAP to work. The example from R2's username is R2 and the password is knowing.\n1R2(config)#username R2 password knowing Again this information needs to be typed on R1 for PAP to work.

CHAP stands for (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) because of the challenge CHAP is a stronger authentication than PAP. CHAP also encrypts the password so it is not sent in plain text. The way to set up CHAP is fundamentally the same. Looking at R2 we are still going to be using the username and password.

While studying for the CCENT exam I had a basic understanding of the OSI Model but when reviewing the material I found myself saying over and over, \u0026quot;Oh ya I remember that\u0026quot;! meaning I totally forgot about a certain protocol or how and what services where in each layer. So I wrote down the basics on the ITS forum and decided why not post it here as well.\nBackground: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) wanted a network model that would standardize data networking protocols to allow communication between all computers and internet connected devices. So in the late 1970s they began to work on the OSI model (Open System Interconnection) However another effort was being made to create a standardized approach towards network devices from the US Defense Department. Researchers at various universities resulted in a competing network model called TCP/IP Around the 1980s the world had many vendor proprietary networking models along with the two standardized network models. Can you guess which one is the winner? (Hint TCP/IP) So why do we still use OSI Model? Think of this as a reference model because that is exactly what this does. The OSI model helps us discus other protocols and is mainly used as a point of reference. Along with it being in the CCENT and CCNA track you need to understand the concepts and terms behind it. Finally the TCP/IP and other protocols almost always are compared to the OSI model.\nThe OSI layer consists of seven layers: Some of the following information was gathered from this source: Odom, Wendell. \u0026quot;The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models.\u0026quot; CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Official Exam Certification Guide. 2nd ed.

They are also the people who you learn from, everybody has a diverse way of doing things and why not learn that “different” way. That's the hope I have in this blog I have put my personal Cisco tutorials and general information for a reference for me but I'll share it to anyone that wants to learn it.\nThis more than just a running-configuration library, I'll post some of my personal opinions on the current and future trends of networking and general technology on this blog. To me networking is becoming a common need throughout the world, and on this blog I’ll focus on things that I like to deal with which is mostly Cisco technologies but expect anything from Cisco tutorials and learning experiences as well as some random thoughts and ideas, let's keep it fun! One of the main reasons of starting this blog was to get better at my writing skills and being able to teach someone with words, I'll do my best in trying to get excellent writing content as well as being correct.\nNot sure where to start? Read about how I passed the ICND1, the ICND2 and or the IINS exams they're all interesting. :) I have 5+ years working in this industry and have always loved technology and especially looking at how we communicate by using data and voice communications, just look at recent events that involve Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media outlets, none of those stories would be available without a network infrastructure!\nCurrently I have a CCNA Data Center Certification and I'm planning on getting more certs in the future, I studied at Idaho State and while I was there I put together an SMF forum for the Information Technology Systems program. At first this was just a project in one of the courses, but I was “hooked” of how it all worked together like how PHP, MySQL and ImageMagick all separate things but in the end work together to make something awesome.\nI find the same concept with team members because everybody has something different to bring to the table, and if you come together why wouldn’t you bring out something awesome!\n","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://ciscoskills.net/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"}]
